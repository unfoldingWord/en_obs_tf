One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, promise me that everything you should receive because you were born first, you will give it all to me.” So Esau promised to give to Jacob all those things. Then Jacob gave him some food.

Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put goatskins on his neck and hands.

##### 07-04

![](.\assets\images\image75.jpeg)

Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau. I have come so that you can bless me.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

##### 07-05

![](.\assets\images\image76.jpeg)

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

##### 07-06

But Rebekah heard of Esau’s plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.

##### 07-07

![](.\assets\images\image78.jpeg)

Jacob lived with Rebekah’s relatives for many years. During that time he married and had 12 sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

After 20 years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his flocks and herds of animals.

##### 07-09

![](.\assets\images\image80.jpeg)

Jacob was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent many of his animals to Esau as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “Your servant, Jacob, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”

##### 07-10

![](.\assets\images\image81.jpeg)

But Esau no longer wanted to harm Jacob. Instead, he was very happy to see him again., so the brothers lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had made to Abraham now passed on from Isaac to Jacob.

**loved to stay at home…loved to hunt** Jacob liked to stay home and Esau like to hunt. How would you express **loved to stay at home…loved to hunt** to mean Jacob enjoyed/preferred staying around the family dwellings and Esau enjoyed/preferred to hunt animals?

**Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau** Rebekah was more fond of Jacob, and Isaac was more fond of Esau. This does not necessarily mean that Rebekah and Isaac did not love the other son, but that each parent had a favorite. How would you express **Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau** to mean Rebekah’s favorite child was Jacob and Isaac’s favorite child was Esau?

#### 07-02

**promise me** Jacob told Esau to make a promise to him: to swear that he would do something. How would you express **promise me** to mean a command telling someone to swear that they would do something?

**everything you should receive because you were born first** According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father’s wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau. How would you express **everything you should receive because you were born first** to mean the rights to the larger portion of wealth from their father?

#### 07-03

**give his blessing** It was customary for fathers to formally express their desire for good things to happen to their children. Normally, the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this extra prosperity to happen to Esau. How would you express **give his blessing** to mean Isaac wanted to formally express his desire for good things to happen to Esau?

#### 07-04

**When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes** Isaac believed he was speaking to Isaac when he felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes.

#### 07-05

How would you express **rights as oldest son** to mean the extra blessing and inheritance the belonged to the firstborn son?

**because** Jacob had stolen The connecting word **because** connects the reason, Jacob stole Esau’s rights and blessing, with the result, Esau hated Jacob. How would you express **because** Jacob had stolen to mean the reason Esau hated Jacob was **because** Jacob had stolen his rights to the inheritance?

**So he planned to kill** Jacob The word So connects the result, Esau planned to kill Jacob, with the reason, Esau hated Jacob. How would you express so he planned to kill Jacob to mean Esau determined to kill Jacob because he hated him?

#### 07-06

**But Rebekah heard Esau’s plan** The connecting word But is used in a contrast relationship. It contrasts Esau’s plan to kill Jacob with Rebekah hearing of it and devising a different plan.

**far away to live with her relatives** Since Abraham’s brother was Rebekah’s grandfather, her relatives were also Isaac’s relatives. How would you express **far away to live with her relatives** to mean the family members who lived in in the same land where she used to live?

#### 07-07

**During that time** Jacob married, had children, and became wealthy while he was living with Rebekah’s relatives. How would you express during that time to mean that Jacob married, had children, and became wealthy while he was living with Rebekah’s relatives?

#### 07-08

**After 20 years** After twenty years living in the land where his relatives were Jacob returned home. Jacob had lived for twenty years in the land where his mother was from.

#### 07-09

**Your servant, Jacob** Jacob was not actually Esau’s servant. But Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau would no longer be angry with him.

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What caused conflict between Esau and Jacob? (07-01)

Favoritism: Rebekah favored Jacob and Isaac favored Esau. When parents have favorites among their children this can cause conflict between the children. (07-01)

Self-Interest: Esau traded his rights as the firstborn son in exchange for food. In a moment of hunger, Esau promised to give Jacob the wealth that was supposed to be for the firstborn. Not only did Jacob take advantage of his brother’s hunger, but Esau also acted rashly to give something so valuable away for one meal. Both Jacob and Esau were self-interested. Jacob took advantage of his brother’s hunger to take the inheritance rights; Esau tried to satisfy his hunger rather than thinking of the long-term inheritance. (07-02)

Deceit: Rebekah and Jacob tricked Isaac by having Jacob dress in goatskins and put on Esau’s clothes. Isaac thought Jacob was Esau. Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau. This act of deception and tricker would cause great conflict between Jacob and Esau. (07-03, 07-04)

Hatred: By tricking Isaac, Jacob stole the blessing from Esau. Because Jacob stole this blessing, Esau hated Jacob and planned to kill him after Isaac died. Stealing and hatred can cause a desire to harm others. (07-05)

##### How did God bless Jacob? (07-06)

Rebekah sent Jacob to live with her relatives. This kept Esau from killing his brother. Jacob lived at a distance from Esau for an extended period of time. (07-6)

During his time away, Jacob married, had children, and increased in wealth. God blessed Jacob with a family and many possessions. (07-07)

After twenty years, Jacob returned home with his family and possessions. Jacob returned home with more than when he left. (07-08)

##### How did the relationship between Jacob and Esau get restored? (07-01)

Jacob was afraid of Esau. He thought Esau wanted to kill him. Sins we commit have have effects later in life. Jacob had to realize the consequences of his sin. (07-09)

Jacob sent a gift to his brother. He was hoping that the gift would cause his brother to no longer want to kill him. (07-10)

When they met, Esau no longer wanted to kill Jacob. They lived peacefully in the land. (07-10)

##### How did keep his covenant promises to the next generation? (07-10)

The younger son gained the rights of the firstborn. In that culture, the firstborn son would be the preferred choice for the greater inheritance. God was doing what many people did not expect. (07-02).

Jacob gained the blessing that Isaac wanted to give to Esau. God was doing what many people did not expect. (07-04).

God caused Jacob to become wealthy. Jacob did not become wealthy on his own. God provided for him even though he did not deserve it. (07-7)

God protected Jacob from his brother. The restored relationship between Jacob and Esau was not something that Jacob. God had made it possible for Esau and Jacob to live peacefully with one another. (07-09)

God caused the covenant promises to continued to the descendants of Jacob. God chose to which descendants he wanted his covenant promises to continue. (07-10)
