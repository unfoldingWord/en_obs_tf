### Open Bible Story: God’s New Covenant

##### 49-01

![](.\assets\images\image565.jpeg)

An angel told Mary, a young woman, that she would give birth to God’s Son. She was still a virgin, but the Holy Spirit came to her and made her become pregnant. She gave birth to a son and named him Jesus. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.

##### 49-02

![](.\assets\images\image566.jpeg)

Jesus did many miracles that show that he is God. He walked on water and stopped storms. He healed many sick people and drove demons out of many others. He raised dead people to life and turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough food to feed over 5,000 people.

##### 49-03

![](.\assets\images\image567.jpeg)

Jesus was also a great teacher. Everything he taught, he taught correctly. People should do what he told them to do because he is the Son of God. For example, he taught that you must love other people the same way you love yourself.

##### 49-04

![](.\assets\images\image568.jpeg)

He also taught that you need to love God more than you love anything else, including your possessions.

##### 49-05

![](.\assets\images\image569.jpeg)

Jesus said it is better to be in God’s kingdom than have anything else in the world. God must save you from your sins in order for you to enter his kingdom.

##### 49-06

![](.\assets\images\image570.jpeg)

Jesus said that some people will accept him. God will save these people. However, other people will not accept him. He also said that some people are like good soil. Because they accept the good news about Jesus, God saves them. However, other people are like the hard soil on a path. God’s Word is like seed that falls on the path, but nothing grows there. These people reject the message about Jesus. They refuse to enter into his kingdom.

##### 49-07

![](.\assets\images\image571.jpeg)

Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He wants to forgive them and to make them his children.

##### 49-08

![](.\assets\images\image572.jpeg)

Jesus also told us that God hates sin. Because Adam and Eve sinned, all of their descendants also sin. Every person in the world sins and is far from God. Everyone is an enemy of God.

##### 49-09

![](.\assets\images\image573.jpeg)

But God loved everyone in the world in this way: he gave his only Son so that God will not punish those who believe in Jesus. Instead, believers will live with him forever.

##### 49-10

![](.\assets\images\image574.jpeg)

You deserve to die because you have sinned. It would be right for God to punish you, but Jesus took the punishment for sin in our place. God punished Jesus by killing him on a cross.

##### 49-11

![](.\assets\images\image575.jpeg)

Jesus never sinned. He accepted the punishment for sin, including the worst possible death. In this way, he was the perfect sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of every person in the world. Jesus sacrificed himself to God, so God will forgive any sin, even terrible sins, of the people who believe in Jesus.

##### 49-12

![](.\assets\images\image576.jpeg)

Even if you do many very good things, this will not make God save you. There is nothing you can do on your own to become friends with him. Instead, you should believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died on the cross instead of you, and that God raised him to life again. If you believe this, God will forgive you for having sinned.

##### 49-13

![](.\assets\images\image577.jpeg)

God will save everyone who believes in Jesus and accepts him as their Master. But he will not save those who do not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you live. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so he can be a friend to you.

##### 49-14

![](.\assets\images\image578.jpeg)

Jesus is calling you to believe in him and to be baptized. Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe you are a sinner and deserve God’s punishment for your sin? Do you believe Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins?

##### 49-15

![](.\assets\images\image579.jpeg)

If you believe in Jesus and confess what he has done for you, you are a follower of Jesus! Satan no longer rules you in his kingdom of darkness. God is now ruling over you in his kingdom of light. God has enabled you to no longer sin as you used to do. He has given you a new, right way of living.

##### 49-16

![](.\assets\images\image580.jpeg)

If you are a follower of Jesus, God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did. Now, God considers you to be a close friend instead of an enemy.

##### 49-17

![](.\assets\images\image581.jpeg)

If you are a friend of God and a servant of Jesus, the Master, you will want to obey what Jesus teaches you. Even though you are a follower of Jesus, Satan will still tempt you to sin. But God always does what he says he will do. He says that if you confess your sins, he will forgive you. He will give you strength to fight against sin.

##### 49-18

![](.\assets\images\image582.jpeg)

God tells you to pray and to study his word. He also tells you to worship him together with other followers of Jesus. You must also tell other people what he has done for you. If you do all these things, you will become a strong friend of his.

#### 49-10

**because you have sinned** People deserve to be punished for their sin. God is right to punish people with death because all people sin. How would you express **because you have sinned** to mean it is right for God to punish you with death because you did evil things and did not follow God’s commands?

#### 49-11

**take away** The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at our sin as if it never existed. If people believe in Jesus, God removes the penalty for their sin. How would you express **take away** to mean remove the punishment for sin?

**so God will forgive any sin** Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice to God. Jesus was punished **so** that people who believed in Jesus would not be punished. The result of this is God will forgive any kind of sin that people commit if they believe in Jesus. How would you express **so God will forgive any sin** to mean the result of Jesus sacrificing himself is God will forgive people of all kinds of sins if they believe in Jesus?

#### 49-12

**If you believe this** God does not forgive the sins of everyone. God forgives the sins of people who believe Jesus is God’s Son who died on the cross as a sacrifice for sin and rose again from the dead. How would you express **If you believe this** to mean God will forgive you of your sin on the condition that you believe that Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross and rose again from the dead?

#### 49-13

**But he will not save those who do not believe in him** God saves everyone who believes. But people who do not believe are excluded from everyone.

#### 49-15

**Satan no longer rules you in his kingdom of darkness** Darkness is used here to refer to sin and everything that is evil. The Bible often compares evil to darkness and goodness to light.

How would you express **Satan no longer rules you in his kingdom of darkness** to mean Satan does not have the power to control people in ways that are evil, like the darkness?

**God is now ruling over you in his kingdom of light** Light here refers to God’s holiness and goodness. The Bible often compares evil to darkness and goodness to light.

#### 49-17

#### 49-18

Jesus walked on water, stopped storms, healed the sick, drove out demons, raised the dead, and fed a crowd of 5,000 with small portions of food. Jesus showed his power over nature, sickness, evil spirits, and death. (49-02)

Preaching: Jesus told people how God saves people. All people have sinned and are enemies of God. He told people what it means to be a part of God’s kingdom and have their sins forgiven. Only people who believe in Jesus will have their sins forgiven and enter God’s kingdom. God loves sinners and wants them to be his children. (49-05, 49-06, 49-07, 49-08)

Cross: God loves people and offered Jesus as a sacrifice for sin. Jesus died on the cross as a sacrifice for sin. Jesus never sinned, so he was the perfect sacrifice for sins.

##### How do people experience God’s salvation and become followers of Jesus? (49-12, 49-13, 49-14)

Believing in Jesus: God saves people who believe in Jesus. True followers of Jesus believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that Jesus is the Messiah, that we are sinners, that Jesus died on the cross as a sacrifice for sin, that Jesus came back to life, and that trusting in Jesus will take away our sins and make us friends with God. To believe in Jesus is to accept Jesus as Master and live their lives in service of Jesus. (49-12, 49-13, 49-14)

2.  When we checked this word with other believers, they said it describes God showing his kindness and favor on someone or something. These are some of the terms that we did not decide to use…

The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
