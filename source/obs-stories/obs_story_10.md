God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be stubborn. When they went to Pharaoh, they said, “This is what the God of Israel says, ‘Let my people go!’” But Pharaoh did not listen to them. Instead of letting the Israelites go free, he forced them to work even harder!

##### 10-02

Pharaoh kept refusing to let the people go, so God sent ten terrible plagues on Egypt. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and all of Egypt’s gods.

God turned the Nile River into blood, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.

God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh begged Moses to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites leave Egypt.

##### 10-05

So God sent a plague of gnats. Then he sent a plague of flies. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them that if they stopped the plague, the Israelites could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from Egypt. But Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go free.

##### 10-06

Next, God caused all the farm animals that belonged to the Egyptians to get sick and die. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go.

##### 10-07

Then God told Moses to throw ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the Egyptians, but not on the Israelites. God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

##### 10-08

After that, God sent hail that destroyed most of the crops in Egypt and killed anybody who went outside. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them, “I have sinned. You may go.” So Moses prayed, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.

##### 10-09

But Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart. He would not let the Israelites go free.

##### 10-10

So God caused swarms of locusts to come over Egypt. These locusts ate all the crops that the hail had not destroyed.

##### 10-11

Then God sent darkness that lasted for three days. It was so dark that the Egyptians could not leave their houses. But there was light where the Israelites lived.

##### 10-12

Even after these nine plagues, Pharaoh still refused to let the Israelites go free. Since Pharaoh would not listen, God planned to send one last plague. This would change Pharaoh’s mind.

## Community Study: Things Which Are Not Proper—Recognizing the Community Damage of Sin

- **Key Idea**: acknowledging the negative impact of sin
- **Key Passage**: Romans 1:28-32
- **Main Session**: OBS 10 (The Ten Plagues)

### Sing to God (3–5 minutes)

Choose a song to sing to praise God and encourage one another.

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)

The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people numerous when they stayed in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it. Acts 13:17

### Read the Passage (5 minutes)

When people reject God, they live in a way that dishonors God and harms others. Christians need to guard themselves against ungodly attitudes, behaviors, and desires. In order to understand the danger of such ungodliness, read the passage below.

> 28 Because they did not approve of having God in their awareness, he gave them up to a depraved mind, for them to do those things that are not proper. 29 They have been filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, and malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and evil intentions. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventing ways of doing evil; they are disobedient to parents. 31 They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and unmerciful. 32 They understand the regulations of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death. But not only do they do these things, they also approve of others who do them. Romans 1:28-32

### Discuss the Idea (10–15 minutes)

Christians should guard themselves against ways of life that are wrong and evil. Use the following questions to discuss the destructive effects of sin in the Christian community.

1.  What are sinful effects that result when people reject God?
2.  How do such sinful ways dishonor God and harm others?
3.  Even though Christians have been set free from sin, how might these sinful ways still damage and disrupt the Christian community?
4.  How can your community guard itself against these sinful ways?

### Pick One from the List (5 minutes)

Thinking about the list of sinful ways, pick one specific sin that you feel could disrupt your community life. Think out loud of the consequences that would result if this sinful way made inroads into your community.

> If the sin of \[choose one from the passage above\] was present in our community, then the results would be…

### Pray to God (5 minutes)

Divide the community into groups of 2–3. Pray that God would guard you as individuals and as a community against the effects of these sinful ways.

How would you express **But Pharaoh did not listen** to mean Pharaoh responded opposite/different from what Moses and Aaron told him?

**he forced them to work even harder!** Pharaoh not only did not free the Israelites, he made their lives even harder.

#### 10-03

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

God sent terrible plagues on Egypt. These plagues brought disaster and death to the Egyptians. (10-02)

God turned the water of the Nile River into blood. God took away the Egyptian source of nourishment. (10-03)

God sent frogs all over Egypt. The frogs were everywhere. This made it really hard to do normal things in life. (10-04)

God sent gnats and flies into the land. The gnats and flies swarmed everywhere. This also made it really hard to live. (10-05)

God caused the farm animals of the Egyptians to get sick and die. God took away the Egyptians work animals and sources of food. (10-06)

God caused Egyptians to have painful skin sores. This affected the Egyptians’ health. (10-07)

God sent hail. This destroyed crops and killed people. God then sent locusts. These locusts ate up the crops of the Egyptians. (10-08, 10-10)

God sent darkness over the land. The Egyptians could not leave their houses. This darkness prevented the Egyptians from experiencing the normal rhythms of day and night. (10-11)

God would send a final plague that would change Pharaoh’s mind. (10-12)

##### How did Pharaoh respond throughout the time God sent the ten plagues?

Stubborn: God told Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh’s heart would be stubborn. Pharaoh would do what Pharaoh wanted to do, not what God wanted to do. It would be difficult to change Pharaoh’s mind. (10-01, 10-12)

Contrary: Pharaoh would not listen to God or obey his commands. (10-01, 10-10)

Oppressive: Instead of obeying God’s commands, Pharaoh caused the Israelites to work harder. Pharaoh’s stubborn and disobedient heart caused him to be even more defiant of God and oppressive of God’s people. (10-01)

Persistent Refusal: Pharaoh continued to be stubborn. Pharaoh kept refusing to listen to God’s commands. Pharaoh persisted in his disobedience and defiance. (10-02)

Temporary Request: At times, Pharaoh asked Moses and Aaron to take away the plagues. Pharaoh asked Moses to take away the frogs. Moses prayed for the flies to go away, the hail to stop. (10-04, 10-05, 10-08)

Unpersuadable: Even though God sent many plagues that caused disaster in Egypt, Pharaoh still did listen to God’s voice. (10-03, 10-04, 10-05, 10-06, 10-07, 10-09, 10-12)

Pharaoh Hardened: Pharaoh hardened his heart. Pharoah would not change his mind and grew even more defiant of God. Pharaoh caused his heart to become like something that is hard and difficult to change. (10-04, 10-05, 10-06, 10-09)

God Hardened: Eventually, God hardened Pharaoh’s heart. God caused Pharaoh to continue in his stubborn refusal to listen to God’s commands. (10-07)

Changed His Mind: When God sent hail that destroyed crops and killed people, Pharaoh admitted that he sinned. At first, Pharaoh let the Israelites go free. However, Pharaoh sinned again, hardened his heart, and refused to let the Israelites go free. (10-08, 10-09)

##### How was God acting on behalf of his people? (10-01, 10-02, 10-0??)

Freedom: God commanded that Pharaoh let the Israelites go free. God sent Moses and Aaron to bring the Israelites out of slavery. (10-01)

Judgment: God sent disaster upon the Egyptians. The Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh slave work. God was defending his people by judging the Egyptians. (10-02)

True God: God showed the Egyptians that he was the true God and that the false gods were not real gods. The plagues that God sent showed that God was more powerful than the false gods the Egyptians worshiped. (10-02)

Distinction: God made a distinction between the Israelites and the Egyptians. We learn that some of the plagues did not affect the Israelites. The Israelites did not get painful skin sores. Darkness came upon the land of Egypt but did not come upon the land where the Israelites were living. God was showing that the Israelites were his people. He would protect them and defend them. (10-07, 10-11)
