He grasped him, took him by the throat, and said, 'Pay me what you owe.' 29 But his fellow servant fell down and implored him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you.' 30 But the first servant refused.

God wants us to resolve conflict with one another. Thankfully, God gives us instructions on how to resolve conflict with other believers when it arises. In order to grow together as a united and one-minded community, read the passage below.

> 15 If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others along with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified. 17 And if he refuses to listen to them, tell the matter to the church. If he also refuses to listen to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven. 19 Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.” Matthew 18:15-20
