# Unit 4: Members Together: Understanding the Nature of Christian Community

This series of studies helps you *understand the nature of Christian community and what it means to be a member of this community*.

## Community Study: One Body, Many Members—Enjoying God's Design of Christian Community

- **Key Idea**: celebrating the unity and diversity of God's people
- **Key Passage**: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)
The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> Then if you are Christ's, you are Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to promise. Galatians 3:29

### Read the Passage (5 minutes)
God forms believers into a community called the church. The church is like a person: one body made up of many parts. God wants his people to be unified and united (to function as one) and celebrate the diversity and uniqueness of individual members (who use their unique giftedness for the good of the community). In order to understand God's design of Christian community, read the passage below.

> 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body is not a single member, but many. 15 If the foot says, "Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it. 19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 So now they are many members, but only one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you." Nor does the head say to the feet, "I have no need of you." 22 But the members of the body that appear to be weaker are essential, 23 and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable, we give them greater honor, and our unpresentable members have more dignity. 24 Now our presentable members have no need to be treated with dignity, for they already have dignity. But God has joined all the members together, and he gave more honor to those that lacked it. 25 He did this so there may be no division within the body, but that the members should care for one another with the same affection. 26 So when one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

If one's gift is prophecy, let it be done according to the proportion of his faith. 7 If one's gift is service, let him serve. If one has the gift of teaching, let him teach. 8 If one's gift is encouragement, let him encourage. If one's gift is giving, let him do it generously.

But if I do not have love, I am nothing. 3 Suppose that I give all I own to feed the poor, and that I give my body to be burned. But if I do not have love, I gain nothing. 4 Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant 5 or rude. It is not self-serving. It is not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs. 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness.
