### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 29-01

**how many times should I forgive** To forgive means to pardon or cancel a debt that is owed. Someone forgives another person when they no longer hold that person guilty or culpable for the wrong they have done/committed. How would you express **how many times should I forgive** to mean how often should I pardon others for things they have done against me?

**my brother** This term sometimes included people who were not actually siblings, but who shared another very strong connection such as religion, ethnic background, etc. How would you express **my brother** to mean a sibling or fellow member of one’s family but can also include someone viewed as brotherly because of common beliefs or shared group identity?

**sins against me** When people disobey God’s commands, they often do wrong against other people. How would you express **sins against me** to mean does something wrong against me?

**Not seven times, but 70 times seven!** Jesus was not talking about an exact number. He was saying that we should forgive people every time they sin against us. How would you express **Not seven times, but 70 times seven!** to mean you should not forgive only seven times, rather you should forgive 70 times seven times?

#### 29-02

**The kingdom of God is like** God rules over people as King. Jesus used a story of a king and his servants to show how God rules over people and what it is like to be under God’s rule. How would you express **The kingdom of God is like** to mean the way God rules people can be compared to?

**to settle accounts with his servants** In this story, one servant owed the king a large debt. The king wanted to collect the debts his servants owed him. How would you express **to settle accounts with his servants** to mean to have the servant repay the king the money he borrowed from the king?

**huge debt** The servant owed the king a very large sum of money. This debt was so large that it was near impossible for the servant to repay the king the full amount. How would you express **huge debt** to mean an enormous amount of money owed to someone else?

#### 29-03

**Sell this man and his family as slaves** The king commanded that the man and his family be made slaves and sold for money so that he could repay his debt to the king. How would you express **Sell this man and his family as slaves** as a command hand over the man and his family to become slavery (forced servitude) in exchange for money?

**to pay his debt** The reason the man would be sold was so that the money received from selling him could pay part of what he owed to the king. How would you express **to pay his debt** to mean to pay back the money he owed to the king?

#### 29-04

**fell on his knees** The servant rapidly came down on his knees before the king. It does not mean he fell down accidentally. This was a way to show his humility and his desire for the king to help him. How would you express **fell on his knees** to mean quickly knelt down on the ground?

**felt pity** The king felt compassion on the servant. The king knew that the servant and his family would suffer greatly if they were sold into slavery. How would you express **felt pity** to mean felt sorry for hardship, pain, or misfortune someone would suffer?

**canceled all of his debt** The king said that the servant did not need to pay back any of the money that he owed the king. Because the servant no longer owed the king money, the servant was free to go and would not be sold into slavery. How would you express **canceled all of his debt** to mean the king abolished/eliminated the servant’s debt and did not make him repay the money he owed the king?

#### 29-05

**a fellow servant** The king had more than one servant. In fact, he had many servants. Both servants in this part of the story were of similar rank before the king. How would you express **a fellow servant** to mean another man who was also a servant of the king?

**Pay me the money that you owe me!** The servant commanded his fellow servant to repay the money that he borrowed from him. How would you express **Pay me the money that you owe me!** to mean repay his debt by giving back to the servant the four month’s wage he had borrowed?

#### 29-06

**Please be patient with me** The fellow servant asked for the servant to give him some time so he could pay back the debt in full. That is, How would you express **Please be patient with me** as a polite and humble plea to not punish him but allow him time pay back the full amount of money he owed the other servant?

**threw his fellow servant into prison** The servant had his fellow servant put in prison because of his debt. The servant forcefully put his fellow servant in prison. How would you express **threw his fellow servant into prison** to mean forcefully had the man put into prison?

#### 29-07

**what had happened** The servant had refused to cancel the other servant’s debt and had put him into prison. How would you express **what had happened** to mean the thing the servant did by not canceling his debt and throwing him into prison?

**greatly disturbed** Other servants observed what the one servant did to his fellow servant. This caused the other servants to be deeply saddened and upset over what happened. How would you express **greatly disturbed** to mean deeply grieved or very distressed?

**everything** The other servants reported to the king how the one servant refused to cancel the debt of his fellow servant and put him in prison. How would you express **everything** to mean they told the king what the servant had done to his fellow servant?

#### 29-08

**called the servant** The king had the authority to command people to do things. The king ordered his guards to bring the servant to him. How would you express **called the servant** to mean commanded the servant to come to him?

**You wicked servant!** The king called the servant evil. He made a strong statement to emphasize how unrighteous the servant was. How would you express **You wicked servant!** as a strong statement that emphasizes that the servant is very evil and morally bad?

**begged me** The one servant pleaded with the king to show him pity and compassion. How would you express **begged me** to mean urgently asked me to be merciful?

**You should have done the same** The king told the servant that the right thing to do was to forgive his fellow servant of his smaller debt because the king had forgiven his much larger debt. How would you express **You should have done the same** to mean you should have forgiven the man who owed you, just as I forgave you?

#### 29-09

**This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you** Jesus said that God would punish people who did not forgive others of sins done against them. How would you express **This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you** to mean God would punish people in the same way the king punished the unforgiving servant if they did not forgive others of wrongs done against them?

**forgive your brother from your heart** Here the heart represents a person’s inner being. Jesus taught that his servants needed to genuinely and honestly forgive others of the debts/wrongs they have done. If they did not forgive others in this way, God would punish them in a similar way to how the king punished the unforgiving servant. How would you express **forgive your brother from your heart** to mean sincerely pardon fellow persons of the wrong they have committed against you?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### How does Jesus use the idea of debt to explain sin? (29-01, 29-02, 29-03, 29-05)

Sin Against One Another: People can sin against other people when they violate God’s commands. (29-01)

Debt: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. When we sin against God, we put ourselves into God’s debt. When we sin against others, we put ourselves in others’ debt. (29-02)

Enormous Debt: One servant owed the king a debt worth 200,000 years’ wage. This huge debt would have been impossible to pay. In fact, the servant in the story could not pay his debt to the king. A person’s debt before God is impossible for people to settle or pay back. (29-02, 29-03)

Slavery: The servant was unable to pay back his debt to the king. As a result, the king punished the servant. He would be sold as a slave. Just like the servant before the king, human sin before God puts us in debt to God which we cannot repay and makes us deserving of punishment. Our sin makes us slaves. (29-03)

Sin Against Others: A fellow servant owed another servant four months’ wages. He was obligated to pay back that debt. When we sin against others, we put ourselves into their debt. (29-05)

##### What does Jesus teach his disciples about offering forgiveness to others who sin against us? (29-01, 29-08, 29-09)

Peter wanted to know how many times he should forgive a brother who sins against him. Christians should expect that they will be wronged by others. (29-01)

Jesus told Peter that he should forgive a brother who sins against him 70 times seven. This meant that God’s people should always forgive those who sin against them. (29-01)

The king told the servant that he should have forgiven his fellow servant as the king had forgiven his debt. We should forgive others as God has forgiven us. (29-08)

Jesus warned people of the consequences of not forgiving others from the heart. We should forgive others with sincerity, honesty, and genuineness. (29-09)

##### What does Jesus teach about how one receives forgiveness? (29-03, 29-04)

Sin and Punishment: The servant recognized that his debt was impossible to pay back and he heard that he would be sold as a slave as his punishment. Recognize the immensity of our debt and the severity of our punishment. (29-03)

Humility: After the servant heard the king announce his punishment, the servant humbled himself by falling on his knees. Only those who are willing to humble themselves and plead with God to be merciful can receive forgiveness. (29-04)

Pity: The king showed pity and mercy to the servant. He canceled his debt and let the servant go freely without needing to repay him the money he borrowed. The king’s pity represents God’s pity and mercy on those he forgives. The only way people can be forgiven of the enormous debt and punishment of sin is to receive God’s mercy and pity. (29-04)

##### How does Jesus warn his disciples about not forgiving others when God has forgiven them? (29-05 ,29-02, 29-03, 29-06, 29-07, 29-08, 29-09)

Smaller Debt: The servant’s debt worth four months’ wages was small compared to the huge debt the servant owed the king. The debt that humans have against each other is small compared to the debt we have before God. (29-05; 29-02, 29-03)

Forceful: The servant who had his debt canceled was forceful and demanding to his fellow servant. He grabbed the servant, demanded payment of his debt, and threw him in prison. One would expect him to be kind after having his larger debt canceled. (29-05, 29-06)

Unforgiveness: The fellow servant pleaded for mercy, but the one servant did not show him pity. Instead, he threw the servant in prison to pay for his debt. The servant did not cancel the small debt of his fellow servant. People often do not forgive other people of sins done against them even though they have received forgiveness from God for a much larger debt/sin. (29-06)

Punishment: The king learned of the servant’s unforgiveness. The king was angry. The king called the servant a wicked servant and threw him in prison. God will punish those who do not forgive others of debts against them. (29-07, 29-08, 29-09)
