# Language Discovery Dialogues: Talking about Your Language on Its Own Terms

## Introduction

Languages share many common characteristics with each other. Languages are also different from each other. Even though languages are similar and different from each other, languages can communicate similar ideas. Each language might communicate one idea in different way because of how the language works. Some languages have technical (special) terms to describe different characteristics of the language. Many languages do not have these special terms. Either way, it is important that you understand how your language works in order to become a good translator. Below are several dialogues to help you become familiar with your language at an introductory level.

1. **Session 1: Parts of Speech: Describing Common Categories of Word Types**
2. **Session 2: Word Order: Clarifying Different Ways to Sequence Words**
3. **Session 3: Sentence Types: Identifying Different Types of Sentences**
4. **Session 4: Punctuation: Hearing Major and Minor Pauses in Speaking**
5. **Session 5: Phrases: Exploring Word Groups**
6. **Session 6: Discourse: Connecting Sentences Together in Larger Units of Thought**
7. **Session 7: Dialogue: Speaking about Things People Say**
8. **Session 8: Figures of Speech: Using Speech in a Non-Literal Way**
9. **Session 9: Pronouns: Referring to People and Things Without Using Their Names**
10. **Session 10: Related Words: Defining and Grouping Key Words in Your Language**
11. **Session 11: Emphasis: Understanding Expression, Emotion, and Tone**

Each language discovery dialogue is designed around a common structure:

1. **Use Your Language**: identify (collect or create) an example from your language where language is used naturally; in field linguistics this is called *language elicitation*
2. **Hear Your Language**: read or listen to the language sample with others
3. **Discuss Your Language**: talk about how your language works; in field linguistics this is similar to a *language survey* or *questionnaire*
4. **Describe Your Language**: summarize what you learned about your language and record these findings in a descriptive grammar reference (i.e., The different groups/kinds of words in our language are..., The typical word order in our language is...); in field linguistics this is called a *descriptive grammar*
5. **Translate Your Language**: apply what you learned to translation practice

In order to discover how you language works, it is important to have examples of your language in written or spoken form. You will discuss these examples in order to describe how your language naturally works. Below are some ways you can get examples of your language. You can use various examples that will best help you talk about the various language topics.

1. **Sample Writing or Recording**: choose a piece of writing or a recording 
2. **Basic Example Sentences**: translate basic example sentence related to the language topic
3. **Retell Visual Story**: observe the video and retell the narrative in your own words
4. **Demonstration with Gestures**: make gestures of certain activities and have people describe what is happening
5. **Create an Example**: create a story, dialogue, or sample from your language to discuss
6. **Enact and Record Role Play**: enact a story, scene, or dialogue and have someone from your language retell what happened (record this retelling by writing or recording)

Narrative, poetry, letters, biographies, legal record, and proverbs are examples of these different styles of writing and speaking. Each kind/style of writing or speaking has certain characteristics, structure/form, and ways of communicating. When languages group sentences together in larger units, they connect these sentences together to show how one sentence is related to another sentence. Many languages use words or marks to show how these sentences are connected together.

Every language can record something that other people say. The are two common ways languages can record speech. Direct speech (recorded speech) records the actual statements/quotation a person has said from the perspective of the original speaker. Indirect speech (reported speech) reports what a person has said from the perspective of the one giving the report. Languages can identify direct and indirect speech in different ways. Sometimes languages use marks or special words to identify direct and indirect speech. There can also be various levels of recorded speech. Someone can record a speech/quotation within a speech/quotation. Some languages can record multiple levels of speech. Other languages might need to turn direct speech into indirect speech in order to make things clear. Discuss the following questions together to explore how your language records speech.

## Introduction

Languages share many common characteristics with each other. Languages are also different from each other. Even though languages are similar and different from each other, languages can communicate similar ideas. Each language might communicate one idea in different way because of how the language works. Some languages have technical (special) terms to describe different characteristics of the language. Many languages do not have these special terms. Either way, it is important that you understand how your language works in order to become a good translator. Below are several dialogues to help you become familiar with your language at an introductory level.

1.  **Session 1: Parts of Speech: Describing Common Categories of Word Types**
2.  **Session 2: Word Order: Clarifying Different Ways to Sequence Words**
3.  **Session 3: Sentence Types: Identifying Different Types of Sentences**
4.  **Session 4: Punctuation: Hearing Major and Minor Pauses in Speaking**
5.  **Session 5: Phrases: Exploring Word Groups**
6.  **Session 6: Discourse: Connecting Sentences Together in Larger Units of Thought**

10. **Session 10: Related Words: Defining and Grouping Key Words in Your Language**
11. **Session 11: Emphasis: Understanding Expression, Emotion, and Tone**

Each language discovery dialogue is designed around a common structure:

1.  **Use Your Language**: identify (collect or create) an example from your language where language is used naturally; in field linguistics this is called *language elicitation*
2.  **Hear Your Language**: read or listen to the language sample with others
3.  **Discuss Your Language**: talk about how your language works; in field linguistics this is similar to a *language survey* or *questionnaire*
4.  **Describe Your Language**: summarize what you learned about your language and record these findings in a descriptive grammar reference (i.e., The different groups/kinds of words in our language are…, The typical word order in our language is…); in field linguistics this is called a *descriptive grammar*
5.  **Translate Your Language**: apply what you learned to translation practice

In order to discover how you language works, it is important to have examples of your language in written or spoken form. You will discuss these examples in order to describe how your language naturally works. Below are some ways you can get examples of your language. You can use various examples that will best help you talk about the various language topics.

1.  **Sample Writing or Recording**: choose a piece of writing or a recording
2.  **Basic Example Sentences**: translate basic example sentence related to the language topic
3.  **Retell Visual Story**: observe the video and retell the narrative in your own words
4.  **Demonstration with Gestures**: make gestures of certain activities and have people describe what is happening
5.  **Create an Example**: create a story, dialogue, or sample from your language to discuss
6.  **Enact and Record Role Play**: enact a story, scene, or dialogue and have someone from your language retell what happened (record this retelling by writing or recording)

Direct speech (recorded speech) records the actual statements/quotation a person has said from the perspective of the original speaker. Indirect speech (reported speech) reports what a person has said from the perspective of the one giving the report. Languages can identify direct and indirect speech in different ways. Sometimes languages use marks or special words to identify direct and indirect speech. There can also be various levels of recorded speech.
