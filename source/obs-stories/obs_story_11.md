## Community Study: A Godly Community—Thinking about the Right Things

- **Key Idea**: focusing our thoughts on things that please God
- **Key Passage**: Philippians 4:8-9
- **Main Session**: OBS 11 (The Passover)

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)

The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> It was by faith that he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch the Israelites’ firstborn sons. Hebrews 11:28

### Sing a Song (3–5 minutes)

Choose a song to sing to praise God and encourage one another.

### Read the Passage (5 minutes)

When people follow God, they live in a way that honors God and encourages others. Christians need to focus their minds on those things which most please God. When we do this, we build up a community of faith. In order to learn about godly ways of thinking, read the passage below.

> 8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is anything excellent, if there is anything to be praised, think about these things. 9 The things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do these things, and the God of peace will be with you. Philippians 4:8-9

### Discuss the Idea (10–15 minutes)

How we think affects the way that we live and interact with others. Use the following questions to discuss the godly types of things we should think about.

1.  What kinds of things should Christians think about?
2.  How does our thinking affect the way we live and interact with others? How does thinking about such things honor God and encourage other Christians?
3.  Why is it important to be intentional/purposeful/proactive about the things we think about?
4.  What practices and habits will your community do to help each other think about such things as you work and serve together?

### Describe One Characteristic (5–10 minutes)

Divide your community into groups of 2–3. Give each group one of the characteristics in the passage above (true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, good report, excellent, to be praised). Each group should try to identify specific thoughts that correspond to that characteristic that would help make your community strong. See the example below.

> **True** thoughts that make the Christian community strong:
> God wants the whole community to participate in his work
> God gifted people in my community in different ways to make the community healthy
> I should honor community members who do not naturally get attention.

### Pray to God (5 minutes)

Use the passage above to pray to God. As a community, ask God to help you think about the specific characteristics above.

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 11-01

**the firstborn males of Egypt’s people and animals** God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, God would kill the eldest son in every Egyptian family and the first male offspring of any of their animals. How would you express **the firstborn males of Egypt’s people and animals** to mean the eldest son in every Egyptian family and the first male offspring of any of their animals?

**if he did not let them go** The word if means that something will happen in the event that something else happens first. God would kill the firstborn males in Egypt in the event that Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go free. How would you express **if he did not let them go** to mean God would kill the firstborn males in Egyptian in the event that Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go free?

**believe** Pharaoh did not trust that what God said was true. What words in your language mean **believe** as in to trust that something is true?

#### 11-02

**God provided** God is the only one who could supply the way to save the Israelites’ sons from death. How would you express **God provided** as in God was the one who supplied a way to save the Israelites’ sons from death?

**to save** God supplied a way to rescue firstborn males from death. This rescue was possible for those who believed in God. How would you express **to save** as in to rescue from death, destruction, or judgment?

**a perfect lamb** This perfect lamb was a young sheep or goat that had no blemishes or defects. How would you express **a perfect lamb** to mean a young sheep or goat that had no blemishes or defects?

#### 11-03

**They should roast the meat** The word should explains something is expected or supposed to happen. It does not explain that the action actually happened yet. God was giving the Israelites instructions and telling them what he expected them to do. How would you express **They should roast the meat** to mean God was giving the Israelites instructions that he expected them to roast the meat of the lamb?

**unleavened bread** Unleavened bread is bread that is prepared without yeast. Yeast is mixed into bread dough to make the dough expand and rise as it bakes. This bread was made without something that would make it rise. Making bread with yeast takes longer than without it, so **unleavened bread** shows that this meal was urgent and the people needed to do it quickly. How would you express **unleavened bread** to mean bread that is prepared without yeast that would normally cause the bread to rise?

**immediately after they ate this meal** The Israelites needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat so they could leave Egypt right away after they finished eating their meal. How would you express **immediately after they ate this meal** to mean the Israelites needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat so they could leave Egypt right away after they finished eating their meal?

#### 11-04

**God went throughout Egypt** God went into every place in the land of Egypt where the people lived to bring judgment on the families who did not follow his command. How would you express **God went throughout Egypt** to mean God went into every place in the land of Egypt where the people lived?

**every firstborn son** This means **every firstborn son** of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. Every Egyptian firstborn son. The firstborn of the Israelite families lived because they had put the blood on their doorposts. This is explained in 11-05. How would you express **every firstborn son** to clearly mean that God killed the firstborn of the families who did not follow his command to put the lamb’s blood around the door?

#### 11-05

**passed over** This means that God passed by those houses and did not stop to kill anyone there. This phrase became the name of the Jewish festival, ‘Passover.’ How would you express **passed over** to mean God moved by the houses which had the lamb’s blood around the door and did not stop to kill anyone there?

**because of the lamb’s blood** The reason God did not kill their firstborn son was the lamb’s blood around the door. The Israelites did not save themselves. Without the lamb’s blood, even the Israelite families would have their firstborn males killed. But God saw that they had killed their lamb as he had commanded, so he did not kill their son. How would you express **because of the lamb’s blood** to mean the reason the Israelites were saved was they had killed their lamb as God had commanded and he did not kill their son because he saw the lamb’s blood around the door?

#### 11-06

**did not believe God or obey his commands** The Egyptians did not trust God and so they did not follow his commands. How would you express **did not believe God or obey his commands** to mean the Egyptians did not trust God and so they did not follow his commands?

**did not pass over** God did not pass by the Egyptian houses. Rather, God stopped at each house and killed their eldest son because they did not have the lamb’s blood around their doors. How would you express **did not pass over** to mean God did not move by the Egyptian houses but stopped at each house and killed their firstborn males?

#### 11-07

**from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail to the firstborn of Pharaoh** This is a way of saying that everyone’s firstborn son died�from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between. How would you express **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail to the firstborn of Pharaoh** to mean everyone’s firstborn son died—from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between?

**wailing** The Egyptians were so sad that they were crying out loud and expressing their sadness with sobbing sounds. What words in your language mean **wailing** as in crying out loud and expressing their sadness with sobbing sounds?

#### 11-08

**called for** Pharaoh told his servants to tell Moses and Aaron to come to him. How would you express **called for** to mean Pharaoh told his servants to tell Moses and Aaron to come to him?

**Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!** This is a command. It is stated as an exclamation because Pharaoh was finally afraid of God and urgently wanted the Israelites to leave Egypt. The words Take and leave describe one action. Pharaoh is commanding Moses and Aaron to go out of Egypt with all the Israelites without delay. How would you express **Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately** as a command in which Pharaoh is ordering Moses and Aaron to go out of Egypt with all the Israelites without delay?

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What did God say he would do because of Pharaoh’s refusal to believe and obey God?

Warning: God sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh to tell him to let the Israelites go free. They warned Pharaoh that God would kill all the firstborn males of Egypt if he did not let them go. God brought a warning of judgment to Pharaoh. (11-01)

Unbelief and Disobedience: Pharaoh refused to believe and obey God. His heart was hard and stubborn. Pharaoh chose to disobey God and did not listen to the warning of judgment. (11-01)

##### How could people escape God’s judgment and have their firstborn males saved?

Divine Provision: God provided a way for anyone to save the firstborn males of their household. This was not something people could provide on their own. Only God could provide the way to save their male firstborn. (11-02)

Belief: To save their male firstborn, people had to believe in God. Only if people believed in God would they be able to have the firstborn saved. (11-02)

Sacrifice: God told the Israelites that they had to sacrifice a perfect lamb. They had to put the blood from the lamb around the door of their houses. (11-02, 11-03)

Haste: God told the Israelites to eat roasted meat and unleavened bread. God would bring them out of Egypt quickly. They should be ready to leave as soon as they left the meal. (11-03)

Obedience: The Israelites not only believed in God, but they did all that God commanded them to do. (11-04)

##### What happened to the Egyptians because they did not believe or obey God?

All People: Every Egyptian firstborn male died. This happened to the firstborn of the prisoner to the firstborn of Pharaoh and everyone in between. God’s judgment was not determined by people’s social class. It was determined by whether someone believed in God and followed his ways. (11-07)

Sadness and Grief: The people of Egypt cried and wailed loudly. They were deeply sad. Not believing God and not following his ways brought about great sadness and grief to the Egyptians. (11-07)

##### What happened to the Israelites because they did believe and obey God?

Passover: God passed over the houses with the lamb’s blood around the door. God killed the male firstborn of the houses without the lamb’s blood around the door. (11-05, 11-06)
