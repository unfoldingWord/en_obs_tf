### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 36-01

**One day** The events of this story actually took place in history. The story does not specify the exact time they occurred. How would you express **One day** to identify true events that actually took place on an unspecified day and at an unspecified time?

**Jesus took three of his disciples** Jesus brought his three disciples up on a high mountain to pray. How would you express **Jesus took three of his disciples** to mean Jesus specifically chose three disciples (Peter, James, and John) to go with him up on a high mountain, and Jesus led them to that place?

**James** This is a different **James** than the one who wrote the Book of **James** in the Bible. How would you express **James** to mean the disciple of Jesus but not the one who wrote the Book of **James** in the Bible?

#### 36-02

**his face became as bright as the sun** At this time, Jesus’ appearance changed. His face became very bright that looked like the brightness of the sun. How would you express **his face became as bright as the sun** to mean Jesus’ face reflected intense light that was compared to (similar to) the bright shining of the sun?

**His clothes became as white as light** At this time, Jesus’ appearance changed. His clothes became very white, like the color of light. How would you express **His clothes became as white as light** to mean Jesus’ clothes changed color and became like the color white which compares to (similar to) the pure color of light?

**whiter than anyone on earth could make them** Jesus’ clothes turned extremely white. This color is so white that it was more white that people could make their clothes when they bleach them. How would you express **whiter than anyone on earth could make them** to mean Jesus’ clothes were more white than people could make their clothes white when they bleach them?

#### 36-03

**appeared** Moses and Elijah were very important people in Israel’s history. God made a covenant with Moses and gave him the law. Elijah was a prophet of God. He spoke God’s messages to people and confronted false gods. They both lived and died hundreds of years ago in past generations. On the mountain, Moses and Elijah showed up out of nowhere. How would you express **appeared** to mean Elijah and Moses suddenly and unexpectedly were present on the mountain?

**because he would soon die in Jerusalem** Moses and Elijah spoke with Jesus about the fact that he would die. They spoke with Jesus about this because Jesus’s death would happen in a short time. Specifically, Jesus would die in the city of Jerusalem. How would you express **because he would soon die in Jerusalem** to mean the reason Moses and Elijah spoke with Jesus about his death was that Jesus would die in Jerusalem in a short time?

#### 36-04

**It is good for us to be here** It is not clear whether us refers only to Peter, James, and John or if it refers to everyone there, including Jesus, Elijah, and Moses. Peter thought it was positive that they were up on the mountain while these events took place. How would you express **It is good for us to be here** to mean it was good that they were on the mountain while these events were happening?

**shelters** Peter wanted to make temporary **shelters** that functioned like tents or garden huts. Peter thought it was a good idea to build these **shelters**. These **shelters** were small, individual, temporary **shelters** like the Jews made from tree branches during an annual Jewish holiday. How would you express **shelters** to mean small, temporary dwellings where people could stay for a short time?

**did not know what he was saying** Peter spoke without thinking clearly because he was so excited about what was happening on the mountain. How would you express **did not know what he was saying** to mean Peter was speaking without really understanding what was happening?

#### 36-05

**a voice coming from the cloud** God spoke out loud and the sound of his voice was heard coming from the clouds. How would you express **a voice coming from the cloud** to mean God spoke and the sound of his voice was heard from the cloud in the sky?

**terrified** Peter, James, and John were very scared when they heard God speak out loud. How would you express **terrified** to mean extremely afraid?

**fell on the ground** The disciples immediately go down on the ground. They did this because they were terrified of the sound of God’s voice. How would you express **fell on the ground** to mean quickly bowed to the ground as an act of awe and fear?

#### 36-06

**touched them** Jesus put his hand on the disciples (perhaps on the shoulder). How would you express **touched them** to mean Jesus placed his hand on the disciples?

**Do not be afraid** Jesus told the disciples not to fear what was happening. This was a command. How would you express **Do not be afraid** as a command to stop being afraid?

**Get up** The disciples were kneeling or laying on the ground, and Jesus instructed them to stand up. How would you express **Get up** as a command to stand up on one’s feet and stop laying/kneeling on the ground?

**the only one still there was Jesus** Moses and Elijah left, and Jesus was the only one of the three remaining. The disciples were still on the mountain with Jesus. How would you express **the only one still there was** Jesus to mean Jesus remained on the mountain after Moses and Elijah left?

#### 36-07

**I will soon die and then come back to life** Jesus explained that he would die sometime in the near future. After his death, Jesus would become alive again. This is a miracle. Only God can make dead people come back to life. How would you express **I will soon die and then come back to life** to mean Jesus would die at a time/day that was not too far in the future, and after his death, he would become alive again?

**After that, you may tell people** Jesus explained to his disciples that they were allowed to tell people about the events on the mountain after Jesus rose from the dead. How would you express **After that, you may tell people** to mean Jesus permitted his disciples to tell others about what took place on the mountain only subsequent to his resurrection from the dead?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions to grasp the truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### Why did Jesus bring his three disciples up on the mountain? (36-01, 36-02)

Solitude/Be By Themselves: Jesus brought Peter, James, and John up to the mountain. He only brought these three of all his disciples. They went up to the mountain to be by themselves. (36-01)

Prayer: Jesus brought the disciples up on the mountain to pray. Jesus’ appearance changed while he was praying. (36-01, 36-02)

##### Learning about Jesus: Jesus’ appearance changed to bright light and whiteness. Jesus brought the disciples on the mountain to teach them about himself and what he had come to do. (36-02)

##### What happened on the mountain that showed who Jesus really is and what he came on earth to do? (36-02, 36-03, 36-05, 36-06, 36-07)

Bright and White: The appearance of Jesus changed. He became bright as the sun and white as light. This showed that Jesus was full of glory and majesty. (36-02)

Jesus as Fulfillment: Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with Jesus. These were important leaders in Israel’s history and faith. Eventually, Moses and Elijah left, and Jesus was the only one of the three left. This highlighted that these important leaders pointed people to Jesus. Jesus is the fulfillment of God’s promises in the Old Testament to send a deliverer. (36-03, 36-06)

Jesus’ Death: Jesus, Moses, and Elijah spoke about the fact that in a short time, Jesus would die in the city of Jerusalem. Jesus would die to save people from their sin. (36-03, 36-07)

Jesus’ Resurrection: Jesus told his disciples that he would come back to life. After Jesus would die in Jerusalem, he would become alive again. In this way, Jesus conquered death and sin. (36-07)

Jesus as God’s Eternal Son: God spoke out loud and explained that Jesus was his Son and he loved him. Jesus is greater than Moses and Elijah. He is God’s eternal Son who is equal to God the Father and deserves worship and praise. (36-05)

##### How did God the Father and Jesus the Son correct his disciples’ understanding of what was happening on the mountain? (36-04, 36-05, 36-06, 36-07)

Ignorance: Peter did not fully understand what was happening. He acted out of ignorance. He wanted to build three shelters to celebrate the Jewish Feast of Booths. In this way, Peter was treating Jesus similarly to Moses and Elijah. However, Jesus is superior to them. Moses and Elijah were the only human leaders chosen by God. Jesus is God’s eternal Son who came to earth as a human to save humanity. Peter is ignorant of the meaning of what was really happening on the mountain. (36-04)

True Faith: Rightly Understanding Who Jesus Is: God spoke out loud and explained who Jesus is. He said that Jesus is God’s Son and God the Father loved him. God wanted Jesus’ disciples to know who Jesus really is. He is God’s eternal Son who came to earth as a human but has existed for all time. (36-05)

Obedience: God told the disciples to listen to Jesus. God wanted Jesus’ disciples to listen and obey what Jesus told them. Following Jesus as a disciple means obeying what Jesus says. (36-05)

Exclusive Trust: Jesus touched his fearful disciples and told them to stop being afraid and to get up. Only Jesus could calm the fears of the disciples. To follow Jesus is to trust Jesus with our lives. It is important that when Jesus did this, Jesus was the only one who was there. Moses and Elijah had left. Moses and Elijah were important figures in Israel’s faith. However, disciples should not put their trust in these people. The only one that a disciple should put their full confidence and trust in is Jesus. (36-06)

Sharing with Others: Jesus instructed his disciples to wait to tell people about what happened on the mountain until Jesus rose from the dead. Jesus’ resurrection would be the appropriate time to speak about these events to others. God wants disciples of Jesus to speak about Jesus to others and tell them about how his death and resurrection can bring them life. (36-07)
