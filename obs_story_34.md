### Open Bible Story: Jesus Teaches Other Stories

##### 34-01

![](.\assets\images\image396.jpeg)

Jesus told many other stories about the kingdom of God. For example, he said, “The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone planted in his field. You know that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all.”

##### 34-02

![](.\assets\images\image397.jpeg)

“But when the mustard seed grows, it becomes the largest of all of the garden plants, big enough that even the birds come and rest in its branches.”

##### 34-03

![](.\assets\images\image398.jpeg)

Telling another story, Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman mixes into some bread dough until it spreads throughout the dough.”

##### 34-04

![](.\assets\images\image399.jpeg)

“The kingdom of God is also like treasure that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and wanted it very much. So he buried it again. He was so filled with joy that he went and sold everything he had so he could buy that field where the treasure was.”

##### 34-05

![](.\assets\images\image400.jpeg)

“The kingdom of God is also like a perfect pearl of great value. When a pearl merchant found it, he sold all that he had so he could buy it.”

##### 34-06

![](.\assets\images\image401.jpeg)

Some people thought God would accept them because they were doing good things. These people despised others who did not do those good things. So Jesus told them this story: “There were two men, both of whom went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader.”

##### 34-07

![](.\assets\images\image402.jpeg)

“The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector over there.’”

##### 34-08

![](.\assets\images\image403.jpeg)

“‘For example, I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of all the money and goods that I receive.’”

##### 34-09

![](.\assets\images\image404.jpeg)

“But the tax collector stood far away from the religious leader. He did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest with his fist and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’”

##### 34-10

![](.\assets\images\image405.jpeg)

Then Jesus said, “I tell you, God heard the tax collector’s prayer, and declared him to be righteous rather than the religious leader. God will dishonor everyone who is proud, but he will honor whoever humbles himself.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 13:31-46; Mark 4:26-34; Luke 13:18-21;18:9-14*

## Community Study: Approved Servants—Aiming to Please God Most of All

- **Key Idea**: seeking for God’s approval in all that we do
- **Key Passage**: 2 Timothy 2:14-26
- **Main Session**: OBS 34 (Jesus Teaches Other Stories)

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)

The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> 33 With many parables like this he spoke the word to them, as much as they were able to understand. Mark 4:33

OR

> 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you. Matthew 6:33

### Describing Faithful Servants (5–10 minutes)

Think about faithful servants of God that you respect. As a community, describe together the characteristics of these faithful servants.

> One faithful servant that I respect is …

> I respect this servant because he/she is …

### Read the Passage (3–5 minutes)

God wants us to serve him faithfully. Our lives and ministry are fully dedicated to God. As a community, read the following Bible passage together to understand what it means to serve God faithfully in your life and ministry.

> 14 Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be ashamed, who accurately teaches the word of truth. 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness. 17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some. 19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness.” 20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. 21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work. 22 Flee youthful lusts. Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. 23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questions. You know that they give birth to arguments. 24 The Lord’s servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach, and patient. 25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth. 26 They may become sober again and leave the devil’s trap, after they have been captured by him for his will. 2 Timothy 2:14-26

### Discuss the Passage (10-15 minutes)

God created us for a specific work in the world. Faithful service to God is doing what God has called us to do. As a community, use the following questions to discuss the teaching of the biblical passage.

1.  How does this passage describe a faithful servant of God?
2.  In what areas of life do faithful servants need to show maturity?
3.  What causes Christians and Christian leaders to be unfaithful? How can you and your community guard against unfaithfulness?
4.  How would you evaluate your community? What areas of growth can you identify?

### Identify a Challenge (5 minutes)

Think about the above discussion. Try to communicate what it means to live a life that God approves.

> God approves people like this…

### Pray to God (5 minutes)

Reflect on what it means to be an approved workman. Pray for people by name in your community. Ask for God to help these people serve God in a faithful and pleasing way.

### Sing a Song (3–5 minutes)

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions to grasp the truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What do the stories/parables that Jesus told teach us about the kingdom of God? (34-01, 34-02, 34-03, 34-04, 34-05)

Stories: Jesus told stories that taught people about God’s kingdom. These stories tell about things that can happen in real life and teach truths about God’s rule over the world. (34-01)

Mustard Seed \| Small to Big: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a mustard seed. Like a small seed that grows into a plant larger than the other garden plants, God’s kingdom will start small and grow to become bigger than all other kingdoms. In fact, like the birds who find rest in the branches of the mustard plant, people will only find real life when they become a part of God’s kingdom. (34-01, 34-02)

Yeast \| Spreads Everywhere: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to yeast. Like yeast/leaven that spreads throughout an entire lump of bread dough, God’s kingdom will start in one place and spread everywhere. (34-03)

Treasure \| Great Joy and Sacrifice: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a treasure. A man hid the treasure in a field. Another man found the treasure. Because he wanted the treasure, the man buried it again and sold all his possessions to purchase the field and own the treasure. This treasure brought the man real joy. Like the treasure that is hidden, the kingdom of God is not entirely visible to all people. It is something people need to desire and search for. Also, the kingdom brings great joy. This joy causes people to get rid of all other valuable possessions and consider God’s kingdom the most valuable thing of all. It is worth people sacrificing everything to be a part of God’s kingdom. God’s kingdom is the only thing that brings real joy. (34-04)

Pearl \| No Flaw and Great Value: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a flawless and costly pearl. Like a pearl that had no defect and was also very expensive, the kingdom of God is perfect and is very valuable. Like the man in the treasure in the field, the pearl merchant sold all his possessions to purchase this pearl. God’s kingdom is without flaw, defect, or error. It is the most valuable thing to be a part of in one’s life. (34-05)

##### What were the different ways the religious leader and the tax collector tried to find acceptance before God? (34-06, 34-07, 34-08, 34-09, 34-10)

Some people thought that they were accepted by God because they behaved well. Many people think that doing good things makes God approve of us. However, this is not the case. No one can be good enough for God to accept him. In fact, relying on our good deeds causes us to treat others as inferior to ourselves. (34-06)

Comparison Is Dangerous: Jesus told a story about a tax collector and a religious leader. The religious leader thought that God accepted him because of his good/moral behavior was better than the behavior/conduct of others. The religious ruler thanked God that he was not sinful like robbers, unjust people, and adulterers. The religious leader compared himself to the tax collector and thought he was better than him. (34-07)

Religious Pride: The religious leader also thought that his religious/pious actions made him acceptable to God. He thought weekly fasting and a regular offering made God accept him more than others. Our religious behavior cannot make us acceptable to God. (34-08)

Humble Repentance: The tax collector was different than the religious leader. The religious leader thought he was righteous but was actually sinful. The tax collector knew he was sinful. The tax collector knew he was not worthy of being accepted by God. The only hope he had was to plead with God for mercy. The tax collector expressed how sad he was over his sin by beating his chest with his fist and begging God for mercy. God accepts those who genuinely come to him in humility and repentance of sin. (34-09)

Declared Righteous: Jesus explained that God heard the tax collectors pray. God showed mercy on the tax collector and declared him righteous. Even though the tax collector was a sinner, God regarded him as righteous (morally right before God) because God forgave his sin. Sinful humans can only be declared righteous by God if their sins are forgiven. Sins will only be forgiven for those who humbly beg God for mercy. (34-10)

Humility: Jesus explained that God dishonors the proud and honors the humble. People who think they are better than others and have confidence in their moral behavior will be rejected by God. Those who humble themselves and realize how low and sinful they are before God will be accepted by God. (34-10)

2.  **Test** the translation with others and record feedback and conversations from in the field (i.e., church and community check)
3.  **Compare** and **contrast** the translation with the source text (i.e., meaning of text and notes) and alternatives (i.e., other translation choices)
4.  **Explain** the reasons why you translated a particular portion of the text.

**Example Sentences That Help Explain Your Translation Decision**

1.  The word \[actual translation\] means to cause good things to happen to someone or something. This term is used when a person desires someone or something to prosper or flourish. This term does not refer to magic or witchcraft.
2.  When we checked this word with other believers, they said it describes God showing his kindness and favor on someone or something. These are some of the terms that we did not decide to use…
3.  Many of our people will understand this word. When we discussed this phrase with the surrounding community, we discovered it was a natural way to describe God causing good and beneficial things to happen.

### Church Community Check

After teaching or ministering this story to the church, check the translation quality with the church community. Record any feedback from your checking experience.

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check your draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identify how each specific phrase was translated into your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
