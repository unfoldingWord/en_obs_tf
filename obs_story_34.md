### Open Bible Story: Jesus Teaches Other Stories

##### 34-01

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image396.jpeg)

Jesus told many other stories about the kingdom of God. For example, he said, “The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone planted in his field. You know that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all.”

##### 34-02

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image397.jpeg)

“But when the mustard seed grows, it becomes the largest of all of the garden plants, big enough that even the birds come and rest in its branches.”

##### 34-03

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image398.jpeg)

Telling another story, Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman mixes into some bread dough until it spreads throughout the dough.”

##### 34-04

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image399.jpeg)

“The kingdom of God is also like treasure that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and wanted it very much. So he buried it again. He was so filled with joy that he went and sold everything he had so he could buy that field where the treasure was.”

##### 34-05

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image400.jpeg)

“The kingdom of God is also like a perfect pearl of great value. When a pearl merchant found it, he sold all that he had so he could buy it.”

##### 34-06

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image401.jpeg)

There were some people who thought God would accept them because they were doing good things. These people despised others who did not do those good things. So Jesus told them this story: “There were two men, both of whom went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader.”

##### 34-07

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image402.jpeg)

“The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector over there.’”

##### 34-08

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image403.jpeg)

“‘For example, I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of all the money and goods that I receive.’”

##### 34-09

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image404.jpeg)

“But the tax collector stood far away from the religious leader. He did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest with his fist and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’”

##### 34-10

![](\en_obs_tf\assets\images\image405.jpeg)

Then Jesus said, “I tell you, God heard the tax collector’s prayer, and declared him to be righteous rather than the religious leader. God will dishonor everyone who is proud, but he will honor whoever humbles himself.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 13:31-46; Mark 4:26-34; Luke 13:18-21;18:9-14*

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What do the stories/parables that Jesus told teach us about the kingdom of God? (34-01, 34-02, 34-03, 34-04, 34-05)

Stories: Jesus told stories that taught people about God’s kingdom. These stories tell about things that can happen in real life and teach truths about God’s rule over the world. (34-01)

Mustard Seed \| Small to Big: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a mustard seed. Like a small seed that grows into a plant larger than the other garden plants, God’s kingdom will start small and grow to become bigger than all other kingdoms. In fact, like the birds who find rest in the branches of the mustard plant, people will only find real life when they become a part of God’s kingdom. (34-01, 34-02)

Yeast \| Spreads Everywhere: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to yeast. Like yeast/leaven that spreads throughout an entire lump of bread dough, God’s kingdom will start in one place and spread everywhere. (34-03)

Treasure \| Great Joy and Sacrifice: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a treasure. A man hid the treasure in a field. Another man found the treasure. Because he wanted the treasure, the man buried it again and sold all his possessions so he could purchase the field and own the treasure. This treasure brought the man real joy. Like the treasure which is hid, the kingdom of God is not entirely visible to all people. It is something people need to desire and search for. Also, the kingdom brings great joy. This joy causes people to get rid of all other valuable possessions and consider God’s kingdom the most valuable thing of all. It is worth people sacrificing everything to be a part of God’s kingdom. God’s kingdom is the only thing that brings real joy. (34-04)

Pearl \| No Flaw and Great Value: Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a flawless and costly pearl. Like a pearl that had no defect and was also very expensive, the kingdom of God is perfect and is very valuable. Like the man in the treasure in the field, the pearl merchant sold all his possessions to purchase this pearl. God’s kingdom is without flaw, defect, or error. It is the most valuable thing to be a part of in one’s life. (34-05)

##### What were the different ways the religious leader and the tax collector tried to find acceptance before God? (34-06, 34-07, 34-08, 34-09, 34-10)

Some people thought that they were accepted by God because they behaved well. Many people think that doing good things makes God approve of us. However, this is not the case. No one can be good enough for God to accept him. In fact, when we rely on our good deeds, it causes us to treat others as inferior to ourselves. (34-06)

Comparison Is Dangerous: Jesus told a story about a tax collector and a religious leader. The religious leader thought that God accepted him because of his good/moral behavior was better than the behavior/conduct of others. The religious ruler thanked God that he was not sinful like robbers, unjust people, and adulterers. The religious leader compared himself to the tax collector and thought he was better than him. (34-07)

Religious Pride: The religious leader also thought that his religious/pious actions made him acceptable to God. He thought weekly fasting and regular offering made God accept him more than others. Our religious behavior cannot make us acceptable to God. (34-08)

Humble Repentance: The tax collector was different than the religious leader. The religious leader thought he was righteous but was actually sinful. The tax collector knew he was sinful. The tax collector knew that he was not worthy to be accepted by God. The only hope he had was to plead with God for mercy. The tax collector expressed how sad he was over his sin by beating his chest with his fist and begging God for mercy. God accepts those who genuinely come to him in humility and repentance of sin. (34-09)

Declared Righteous: Jesus explained that God heard the tax collectors pray. God showed mercy on the tax collector and declared him righteous. Even though the tax collector was a sinner, God regarded him as righteous (morally right before God) because God forgave his sin. Sinful humans can only be declared righteous by God if their sins are forgiven. Sins will only be forgiven of those who humble beg God for mercy. (34-10)

Humility: Jesus explained that God dishonors the proud and honors the humble. People who think they are better than others and have confidence in their moral behavior will be rejected by God. Those who humble themselves and realize how low and sinful they are before God will be accepted by God. (34-10)
