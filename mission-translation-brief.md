# Mission-Translation Brief

## Introduction

This **Mission-Translation Brief** assists churches and networks who want to *center the task of Bible translation in the context of the church*. When the church is at the center of the Bible translation process, Bible translation serves the mandate of the Great Commission, unifies the whole church around the translation task, establishes the church as a mature faith community, and results in a quality Bible translation that is trusted by the local community. Because Church-Centric Bible Translation (CCBT) focuses on building capacity within each lingual church, CCBT equips the church to be able to produce, maintain, update, and revise Bible translations into the future.
