### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 24-01

**grew up and became a prophet** God had chosen John to be a prophet before he was born. John would serve God as a prophet when he became an adult. How would you express **grew up and became a prophet** to mean John served God as a prophet when he became an adult?

**the wilderness** John lived in a place that was like a desert and removed from where other people typically lived. There were few people living out in this area. How would you express **the wilderness** to mean a remote, desert-like place?

**wild honey** This honey was the natural product of bees in the wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people would understand by the word honey, you may not need to call it wild. How would you express **wild honey** to mean the natural product of bees that is found in nature and that is not cultivated by people?

**locusts** These were large, hopping insects with wings, like very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them. How would you express **locusts** to mean large hopping insects with wings that are like grasshoppers?

**wore clothes made from camel hair** A camel is an animal that has very rough hair. People could make clothing out of it. These clothes would not quickly wear out in the wilderness as other clothes would. This clothing symbolizes that John was a prophet like the prophets from long ago, especially the prophet Elijah. How would you express **wore clothes made from camel hair** to mean John wore clothes that were made from coarse clothes made of camel hair (rough animal hair)?

#### 24-02

**Repent** John commanded people to turn away from their sins and stop disobeying God. When people repent, they forsake their sins. How would you express repent as a command that instructs people to stop disobeying God and turn away from their sins?

**the kingdom of God is near** John preached that the kingdom of God was ready to appear. This meant that God’s reign was about to begin and soon rule over his people as king. How would you express **the kingdom of God is near** to mean the time of God’s reign was about to begin when God would rule over his people as king?

#### 24-03

**When people heard John’s message, many of them repented from their sins** People listened to John’s message. At the time they heard him preach, many people turned away from their sins. How would you express **When people heard John’s message, many of them repented from their sins** to mean many people stopped disobeying God and turned from their sins at the time they heard John preach?

**baptized** When people repented from their sins, John immersed them in water. This was a ritual act of publicly confessing sin, repenting from sin, and expressing a desire to follow God. How would you express **baptized** to mean to be immersed in water as a public ritual of commitment?

**but they did not repent or confess their sins** Many people turned from their sins when they heard John preach. In contrast to this, many religious leaders did not turn away from their sins and did not confess their sins when they heard John preach. How would you express **but they did not repent or confess their sins** to mean many religious leaders did the opposite of those who repented from their sins when they heard John preach?

**confess their sins** To confess is to acknowledge that something is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had sinned. How would you express **confess their sins** to mean to acknowledge that it is true that they have disobeyed God?

#### 24-04

**You poisonous snakes** John compares the religious leaders to poisonous snakes. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. John said that these religious leaders represented evil and dangerous. How would you express **You poisonous snakes** to mean dangerous and evil like venomous snakes?

**God will cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit** John is not really talking about trees. John speaks of the religious leaders as if they were trees that bear bad fruit. The bad fruit represents bad actions of sining and disobeying God. As a person gets his axe ready to cut down and burn a tree that grows bad fruit, God is ready to punish people for their sins. This means God is ready to punish sinners. How would you express **God will cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit** to mean God has his axe and he is ready to cut down and burn any tree that grows bad fruit?

**he will throw them into the fire** John compares God’s judgment of sinners as throwing trees that bear bad fruit into the fire. Just as the fire would destroy the bad trees, God would punish those whose actions and attitudes did not come from God. How would you express **he will throw them into the fire** to mean God will judge each person who does not do follow God’s ways and punish by destroying them like would happen if someone threw a tree into a fire?

**John fulfilled** Prophets said that God would send a messenger who would come ahead of the Messiah in order to prepare the way for the Messiah. John was this messenger whom the prophets spoke about. He did what the prophets said the messenger would do. How would you express **John fulfilled** to mean John was doing what the prophet said God’s messenger would do?

**See** The prophets told people to look and see what God would do. How would you express **See** to mean look and pay attention?

**I will soon send my messenger ahead of you** This is a message the prophets spoke. The prophets said God would send a messenger who would come before the Messiah. How would you express **I will soon send my messenger ahead of you** to mean Yahweh would send his messenger that would come before the Messiah would come?

#### 24-05

**He is so great** John said that the Messiah was very important. How would you express **He is so great** to mean the Messiah is very important and prominent?

**I am not even worthy to untie his sandals** Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John was saying that the one who would come is so great that John was not even worthy to be his slave. John was showing humility when he said this. How would you express **I am not even worthy to untie his sandals** to mean Jesus was so great that John did not deserve to even be his slave and do a lowly task of untying sandals?

#### 24-06

**Look!** John was pointing out that Jesus was present and was very important. He was calling his listeners to pay attention and take notice of him. How would you express **Look!** as a strong statement that calls people to pay attention to something really important?

**the Lamb of God** John speaks of Jesus as if Jesus is a lamb from God. John compares Jesus to a lamb to show that he is God’s perfect sacrifice who can take away sin. How would you express **the Lamb of God** to mean Jesus is God’s perfect sacrifice—as a lamb would be a sacrifice—who would be sacrificed to pay for people’s sins?

**will take away** Jesus is God’s perfect sacrifice who can remove and cleanse people from sin. As a sacrifice, Jesus makes it possible for sin to be forgiven and for people will not be punished for their sin. How would you express **will take away** to mean to remove sin so that God looks at our sin as if it never existed?

**the sin of the world** The word is a metonym and refers to all the people in the world. How would you express **the sin of the world** to mean the evil things done by the people who live in the world?

#### 24-07

**I am not worthy to baptize you** John said that he was not good enough to baptize Jesus. John recognized that he was sinful and did not think he should baptize Jesus. He thought Jesus should baptize him. How would you express **I am not worthy to baptize you** to mean John saw himself as sinful and did not think he was fit to baptize Jesus?

**because it is the right thing to do** Jesus never sinned. He was not baptized to repent from his sin. Jesus did not need to repent from sin because he never committed sin. Instead, Jesus was baptized to show what it means to be truly right. How would you express **because it is the right thing to do** to mean it is the proper thing that God wanted him to do?

**even though** Jesus had never sinned Baptism is sign of repentance. Some might think that Jesus’ baptism meant that Jesus was repenting from his own sin. But Jesus never sinned, so he had no need to repent. Other people were baptized and repented from their sin. Jesus was baptized to show that he always did what was right. How would you express **even though** Jesus had never sinned to mean Jesus was baptized to do what was right before God and this was a different reason sinful people were baptized when they repented from their sin?

#### 24-08

**after being baptized** John baptized Jesus by immersing him under the water. This is an action John did to Jesus. How would you express **after being baptized** to mean after John baptized Jesus by immersing him under the water?

**Spirit of God** appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him After Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus. This means that the Holy Spirit either came upon Jesus as a bird descends from the sky or the Holy Spirit looked like an actual dove when he descended upon Jesus. How would you express **Spirit of God** appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him to mean the Holy Spirit descended upon and remained with Jesus as a dove descending from the sky and resting somewhere?

**This is my Son** This is an important title for Jesus. Jesus is God’s eternal Son who is at the same time equal to his Father and distinct from his Father. How would you express **This is my Son** to mean Jesus is the Son of God the Father?

#### 24-09

**God had told John** God had already spoken to John and told him that the Holy Spirit would come upon and remain on the one he baptized. How would you express **God had told John** to mean could mean Before Jesus came to be baptized, God had told John?

**But when John baptized Jesus, he heard God the Father speak, saw God the Son, who is Jesus, and he saw the Holy Spirit** There is only one God. At the same time, God is three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. How would you express **But when John baptized Jesus, he heard God the Father speak, saw God the Son, who is Jesus, and he saw the Holy Spirit** to mean there is one God who eternally exists as three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them.

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
