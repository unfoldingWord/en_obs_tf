One day, a rich young ruler came up to Jesus and asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me ‘good’? There is only one who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God’s laws.”

##### 28-02

![](.\assets\images\image336.jpeg)

“Which ones do I need to obey?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.”

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)

The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.” Luke 16:13

OR

> “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. 24 Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. Luke 9:23-24

### Think Together (5 minutes)

Think about what it means to be committed to God as a servant is committed to a master. Describe how this would help explain what commitment to Jesus looks like.

> Christians are committed to God like a servant is committed to a master. This means…

### Read the Passage (3–5 minutes)

Christians can only be fully committed to one master. As a community, read the following Bible passage together to understand what it means to be committed to Jesus and his work.

> 19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 22 The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness! 24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. Matthew 6:19-24

### Discuss the Passage (10-15 minutes)

Jesus tells his disciples to be fully committed to God. When Christians are fully committed to God, they live for things that last forever. As a community, use the following questions to discuss the teaching of the biblical passage.

1.  How can we tell what we are really committed to?
2.  What kinds of things threaten our commitment to God? What things do you/people treasure that can take their commitment away from God?
3.  How does this passage help us understand what it means to be fully committed to God and his work?
4.  How can your community grow in its undivided commitment to God?

### Evaluate Your Own Heart (5 minutes)

Think about what things you treasure in your heart. Identify those things that you treasure that will compete for your devotion to God.

### Pray to God (5 minutes)

Divide the community into groups of 2–3 people. Pray for other members of your group, using portions of the above passage. You can use the following examples to help guide your time of prayer.

> God, guide \[name of person\] to store up for themselves treasures in heaven.
> God, strengthen \[name of person\] to treasure things that last forever.
> God, help \[name of person\] to not serve money but to serve you alone.

### Sing a Song (3–5 minutes)

Choose a song to sing to praise God and encourage one another.

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 28-01

**a rich young ruler** This person was wealthy, young, and powerful. How would you express **a rich young ruler** to mean a rich and powerful political official who was still young?

**came up to Jesus** The rich young ruler came near to Jesus in order to speak with him. How would you express **came up to Jesus** to mean approached Jesus?

**Good teacher** The rich young ruler addressed Jesus as morally upright and respectable. He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher. How would you express **Good teacher** to mean righteous teacher?

**There is only one who is good, and that is** God Jesus does not deny that he himself is good. Jesus simply asked the rich young ruler why he called Jesus good. Jesus explained that the only one who is truly good is God. How would you express **There is only one who is good, and that is** God to mean God is the only one who is truly good?

**if you want to have eternal life, obey** God’s laws Eternal life means to live forever with God, even after this present life. Jesus explained that people can receive eternal life if they obey God’s commands. How would you express **if you want to have eternal life, obey** God’s laws to mean you must obey God’s commands in order to live forever with God?

#### 28-02

**Which ones do I need to obey?** The rich young ruler asked Jesus which commands he needed to obey in order to have eternal life. How would you express **Which ones do I need to obey?** as a question which asks which laws does one need to obey in order to live forever with God?

**love your neighbor as you love yourself** Jesus explained that one of the laws people needed to obey was to love one’s neighbor as much as one loves himself. This means that people are to show genuine concern for others the way they would care for their own wellbeing. How would you express **love your neighbor as you love yourself** to mean to show genuine concern for others to the same degree that you would yourself?

#### 28-03

**ever since I was a boy** The rich young ruler said that he obeyed all of the laws Jesus listed as a child and up to the present day/time. How would you express **ever since I was a boy** to mean from the time I was a child until now?

**What do I still need to do** The rich young ruler asked Jesus what else he needed to do to have eternal life. The young man said that he obeyed all of the commands Jesus listed since he was a child. However, he still felt there was something else he needed to do to have eternal life. How would you express **What do I still need to do** to mean what else do I need to do in addition to obeying these commands?

**loved him** Jesus had compassion on him. This compassion is the kind of concern and care God has for people. How would you express **loved him** to mean Jesus felt a genuine concern and compassion for the young man?

#### 28-04

**perfect** Jesus told the rich young man how he could become morally upright before God. How would you express **perfect** to mean completely righteous?

**sell everything you own** Jesus told the rich young man that he could become completely righteous if he sold everything that belonged to him and gave that money to poor people. How would you express **sell everything you own** to mean sell all your possessions?

**treasure in heaven** Jesus explained that God would reward the young man with great wealth in heaven if he sold all of his possessions and gave the money to poor people. How would you express **treasure in heaven** to mean God will reward you with riches located in heaven that you will receive when you arrive there?

#### 28-05

**When the young man heard what Jesus said** Jesus told the man to give away all of his possessions to poor people. At the time the young man heard Jesus’ instruction, he became very sad. How would you express **When the young man heard what Jesus said** to mean the young man became very sad at the time he heard Jesus tell him to give away what he owned?

**because he was very rich** The reason the man became very sad was he was very wealthy and did not want to give away all that he owned. How would you express **because he was very rich** to mean the reason the rich young ruler was very said was he owned many possessions and did not want to sell them?

#### 28-06

**It is extremely hard for rich people to enter into the kingdom of God!** Jesus made a strong statement that it is very difficult for wealthy people to live forever with God in his kingdom. His disciples may not have expected this to be true about wealth people. How would you express **It is extremely hard for rich people to enter into the kingdom of God!** as a strong statement that emphasizes it is very difficult for people with a lot of wealth/possessions to become a citizen in God’s kingdom?

**it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God** Jesus made an exaggerated statement that emphasized the difficulty of a rich person becoming a citizen in God’s kingdom. Camels are very large animals (with humps on their backs) that are often used to carry heavy loads. Jesus explained that it is harder for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom than for a camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle. Jesus says this to represent something that is impossible. How would you express **it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God** to mean it is more difficult for a person to become a citizen in God’s kingdom than for a camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle?

#### 28-07

**they were shocked** The disciples were very surprised about how hard it is for a rich person to become a citizen in God’s kingdom. They believed that God made people rich because they were more righteous than other people. How would you express **they were shocked** to mean greatly astonished at what Jesus said?

**If it is like this, who will God save?** The disciples asked Jesus a question that expressed their shock and surprise. The disciples were surprised that if God does not save rich people, then it seems like he will not save anyone. It seemed to the disciples that every person would face God’s judgment and condemnation for their sin. How would you express **If it is like this, who will God save?** as a question that means if it is as difficult for rich people to enter God’s kingdom as Jesus said, then who will God rescue from judgment and condemnation?

#### 28-08

**It is impossible for people to save themselves** People do not have the ability to save themselves from God’s judgment. All humans are imperfect sinners who deserve God’s punishment for their sin. No person can rescue himself/herself from this condemnation. How would you express **It is impossible for people to save themselves** to mean people do not have the power or ability to rescue themselves from God’s judgment?

**nothing is impossible for God to do** Jesus explained that things that God can do things that are impossible for people to do. God is able to do anything, even save a rich person. How would you express **nothing is impossible for God to do** to mean God is able to do impossible things, so he can save even a rich person?

#### 28-09

**We disciples have left everything** The disciples explained that they left all their possessions behind to follow Jesus. How would you express **We disciples have left everything** to mean the disciples gave up everything they owned to follow Jesus?

**What will be our reward?** The disciples asked Jesus how God would reward them for leaving everything they owned and following Jesus. How would you express **What will be our reward?** as a question that asks what will God give us as a reward?

#### 28-10

**100 times more** Jesus told his disciples that those who counted God as more important than all other things would receive much more in the future. To receive **100 times more** is not naming a specific number but communicating that faithful disciples who leave behind important things to follow Jesus will receive a lot more in the future than they presently have. How would you express **100 times more** to mean very much more than he had before?

**many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first** Here first and last refer to people’s status or importance. Jesus is contrasting people’s status now with their status in the kingdom of heaven. Many people who are important now, will not be important later. Many people who are considered now to be of little value on earth will be highly valued in heaven. How would you express **many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first** to mean many who seem to be important now will be the least important, and many who seem to be unimportant now will be very important?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What did Jesus teach about how someone receives eternal life? (28-01, 28-02, 28-03, 28-04, 28-05)

Obedience: One day, a rich young ruler asked Jesus what he needed to do to have eternal life. Jesus told the man that he needed to obey God’s commands to have eternal life. (28-01)

Something Was Lacking: Jesus listed some of God’s commands and the man said that he obeyed those commands since he was a child. He wanted to know what else he needed to do to have eternal life. The man recognized that his obedience to these commands was not enough. No person’s obedience is good enough to gain eternal life. (28-02, 28-03)

Full Commitment: Jesus told the man that if he wanted to be perfect he needed to sell all his possessions and give the money to poor people. This would show his full commitment that God was most important to him, even more important than his possessions. (28-04)

Following Jesus: Jesus told the man to follow him. One can only have eternal life by following Jesus. We follow Jesus when we make Jesus most important in our lives. (28-04)

The rich young ruler was very sad because he was rich and did not want to lose his possessions. His possessions were more important than following Jesus. People can only receive eternal life when they value future reward as more important than present possessions. (28-05)

##### What keeps people from being saved/receiving eternal life? (28-01, 28-03, 28-06, 28-07, 28-08)

Wealth, Youth, and Power: The rich young ruler was wealthy, youthful, and powerful. Our possessions, youth, and positions of power can keep us from following Jesus. (28-01)

Failed Obedience: Jesus said that the man needed to obey God’s laws to be saved. Yet, even when the man said he obeyed God’s laws, he wanted to know what else was needed to have eternal life. No one can obey enough/sufficiently to gain eternal life. If we rely on our own obedience to save ourselves we will not gain eternal life. (28-03)

Hard for Rich to Be Saved: Jesus taught his disciples that it is very hard for rich people to enter God’s kingdom. It is harder for a rich man to be saved than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. This does not mean that rich people cannot be saved. It means that rich people tend to value their possessions more than God. It takes a major change in one’s life to follow Jesus and be saved. (28-06)

Only God Can Save: The disciples were shocked at Jesus’ teaching and wondered who could be saved. Jesus told his disciples that it is impossible for a person to save himself. This is something that only God can do. (28-07, 28-08)

##### What did Jesus explain to his disciples about what it means to genuinely follow Jesus? (28-04, 28-05, 28-09, 28-10)

Following Jesus: The disciples told Jesus that they left their possessions to follow Jesus. The rich young ruler would not give up his possessions to follow Jesus. Following Jesus means giving up present possessions for a future reward. (28-04, 28-05, 28-09)

Sacrifice: Jesus explained to his disciples that following Jesus will involve sacrifice. Jesus told his disciples that people must give up important things now in order to follow Jesus. People who consider Jesus as more important than houses, family, and property prove that they are true followers of Christ. Also, those who give up important things now will be much more blessed in the future. In addition to blessing, people who sacrifice and follow Jesus will receive eternal life. (28-10)

Humility: Jesus explained to his disciples that following Jesus will involve humility. Jesus told his disciples that those who are first/important now will be last/unimportant later on; those who are last/unimportant now will be first/important later on. Those who are important now hesitate to follow Jesus because of what it will cost them. It requires humility to put oneself in a less important position in this present life to follow Jesus. (28-10)

##### What did Jesus promise to those who genuinely followed Jesus? (28-01, 28-03, 28-04, 28-06, 28-07, 28-08, 28-09, 28-10)

Eternal LIfe: People who genuinely follow Jesus gain eternal life and live forever. (28-01, 28-03, 28-10)

Treasure in Heaven/Reward: People who genuinely follow Jesus will have treasure in heaven. Those who give up their possessions now to follow Jesus will become richly blessed and rewarded in the future. (28-04, 28-09, 28-10)
Kingdom Citizen: People who genuinely follow Jesus will become citizens of God’s kingdom. (28-06)

Saved: People who genuinely follow Jesus will be saved/rescued from God’s wrath and judgment of their sin. (28-07, 28-08)

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check you draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identity how each specific phrase was translated in your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
