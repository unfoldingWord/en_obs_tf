### Open Bible Story: God’s Covenant with Abraham

##### 04-01

![](.\assets\images\image46.jpeg)

Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they still sinned against God and each other. Because they all spoke the same language, they gathered together and built a city instead of spreading out over the earth as God had commanded.

##### 04-02

![](.\assets\images\image47.jpeg)

They were very proud, and they did not want to obey God’s commands about how they should live. They even began building a tall tower that would reach heaven. God saw that, if they all kept working together to do evil, they could do many more sinful things.

##### 04-03

![](.\assets\images\image48.jpeg)

So God changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

##### 04-04

![](.\assets\images\image49.jpeg)

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All families on earth will be blessed because of you.”

##### 04-05

![](.\assets\images\image50.jpeg)

So Abram obeyed God. He took his wife, Sarai, together with all of his servants and everything he owned and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.

##### 04-06

![](.\assets\images\image51.jpeg)

When Abram arrived in Canaan, God said, “Look all around you. I will give to you all this land, and your descendants will always possess it.” Then Abram settled in the land.

##### 04-07

![](.\assets\images\image52.jpeg)

There was a man named Melchizedek who was a priest of God Most High. One day, after Abram had been in a battle, he and Abram met. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had won in the battle.

##### 04-08

![](.\assets\images\image53.jpeg)

Many years went by, but Abram and Sarai still did not have a son. God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God’s promise. God declared that Abram was righteous because he believed in God’s promise.

##### 04-09

![](.\assets\images\image54.jpeg)

Then God made a covenant with Abram. Normally, a covenant is an agreement between two parties to do things for each other. But in this case, God made a promise to Abram while Abram was in a deep sleep, but he could still hear God. God said, “I will give you a son from your own body. I give the land of Canaan to your descendants.” But Abram still did not have a son.

## Community Study: One Body, Many Members—Enjoying God’s Design of Christian Community

- **Key Idea**: celebrating the unity and diversity of God’s people
- **Key Passage**: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27
- **Main Session**: OBS 4 (Covenant with Abraham)

### Recite the Creedal Verse (3–5 minutes)

The verse below summarizes the teaching of the current passage. Read the verse out loud as a community. Read it again several times as a group until the whole community can recite it from memory.

> Then if you are Christ’s, you are Abraham’s descendants, and heirs according to promise. Galatians 3:29

### Read the Passage (5 minutes)

God forms believers into a community called the church. The church is like a person: one body made up of many parts. God wants his people to be unified and united (to function as one) and celebrate the diversity and uniqueness of individual members (who use their unique giftedness for the good of the community). In order to understand God’s design of Christian community, read the passage below.

> 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body is not a single member, but many. 15 If the foot says, “Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body,” it is not any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it is not any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it. 19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 So now they are many members, but only one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you.” Nor does the head say to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 But the members of the body that appear to be weaker are essential, 23 and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable, we give them greater honor, and our unpresentable members have more dignity. 24 Now our presentable members have no need to be treated with dignity, for they already have dignity. But God has joined all the members together, and he gave more honor to those that lacked it. 25 He did this so there may be no division within the body, but that the members should care for one another with the same affection. 26 So when one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

### Explore the Idea (10–15 minutes)

The above passage introduces us to God’s design for Christian community. Use the following questions to learn what it means for your group to function like one body made up of many members.

1.  How does this passage describe what it means to be a part of the church community?
2.  What are some challenges of being a part of a community that acts as one body and is made up of different individual members?
3.  How can a Christian community encourage the unity of the whole group and also celebrate the unique giftedness of diverse members?
4.  What are ways your community can realize God’s vision for being one body made up of many parts?

### Envision the Community (5–10 minutes)

Think about what it would look like for your community to remain unified and also celebrate the uniqueness of each member. Imagine what the fruit might be to work in such a God-honoring community.

> By God’s help, if our community acts as one body with many members, then the result would be…

### Pray to God (5 minutes)

Christians can only enjoy the unity and diversity of Christian community with God’s help. It is not possible to maintain Christian community in our own human strength. Spend time praying as a community that God would help you realize the vision of the above passage and work together as a body.

### Sing a Song (3–5 minutes)

Reflect on what it means to be a Christian community. Sing a song that celebrates God’s work in forming God’s people together as a unified body.

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 04-01

**the same language** At this time, there was only one language, so they could all understand each other. How would you express **the same language** to mean all people spoke one language and could communicate with each other?

**gathered together** The people at this time came together and stayed close to one another. God commanded humans to spread out over the earth. How would you phrase **gathered together** to mean people came together into one area?

**a city** A city is a place where a lot of people live and work close together. It is a large town. What words in your language mean **a city** as in place where many people live and work in a similar area?

#### 04-02

**very proud** The people thought very highly about themselves. A proud person often does not admit his own faults and thinks he is better than others. He is not humble. How would you translate **very proud** to mean the people thought very highly of themselves and considered themselves to be very great?

**a tall tower that would reach heaven** This structure was so tall that its top would be in the sky. How would you express **a tall tower that would reach heaven** to mean a tall building that would be as high as the sky?

#### 04-03

**changed their language** In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that, suddenly, they were no longer able to understand each other. How would you express **changed their language** to mean God made the people speak in different languages?

**spread the people** When God changed their languages, God caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth. Each group moved to its own area. How would you express **spread the people** to mean God caused the people to move and live in different places?

**confused** The name of the city was called Babel. This word in Hebrew sounds like the word for **confused**. To be **confused** means to be unable to understand what someone is saying. When God changed the languages of the people, they were unable to understand each other. What words in your language mean **confused** as in to be mixed up or unable to understand?

#### 04-04

**bless** To **bless** someone or something means to cause good and beneficial things to happen to the person or thing that is being **bless**ed. When God **bless**es someone, they prosper. What words in your language mean **bless** as in to cause good and beneficial things to happen?

**make you a great nation** God would cause Abram to have many descendants, and they would become a large and important nation or country. How would you express a great nation to mean God would cause Abram’s descendants to be a large and important people or country?

**will make your name great** This means that God would cause Abram to have a good reputation and be known by many people in the world. How would you translate **will make your name great** to mean God would cause Abram and his family to be well-known throughout the world and people would think well of them?

#### 04-05

**obeyed** To obey means to follow someone’s commands. Abram did what God told him to. What words in your language mean **obeyed** as in to follow the orders or instructions of someone else?

**God showed him** Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was to go. The text doesn’t tell how **God showed him**. How would you express **God showed him** to mean that God made it clear and obvious where Abram should go?

#### 04-06

**possess** To **possess** the land means to own the land and dwell in it. God promised to give the land to Abram and also to his descendants. God promised they would own it and dwell in it forever. How would you express **possess** to mean that they would own the land of Canaan as a place to live?

**settled** Abram and his family lived in the land of Canaan. To settle means to stay in a place where one lives. What words in your language mean **settled** as in to live in a place by dwelling there?

#### 04-07

**priest** A **priest** is someone God has chosen to offer sacrifices to God on behalf of God’s people. Priests also offered regular prayers to God on behalf of his people and performed other religious rites. What words in your language would you use for a **priest** as a person God has chosen to offer sacrifices? What does a **priest** do in your culture? How similar is this term to the biblical idea of a **priest**?

**God Most High** The people of Canaan worshiped many false gods. The title Most High God explains that the God that Melchizedek worshiped was far superior to all of them, and was the same God that Abram worshiped. How would you express **God Most High** to mean the one and only supreme God who is superior to all?

#### 04-08

**promised** To promise means to say something that is guaranteed to happen. God gave an oath that he would never destroy the earth with a flood again. How would you translate **promised** to mean God said something that he guaranteed would happen?

**as the stars in the sky** This expression means that Abram’s descendants will be so many that no one can count them all. How would you express **as the stars in the sky** to mean Abram’s descendants would be so many that they could not be counted?

**believed** To believe means to accept or trust that it is true. What words in your language mean **believed** as in to trust or accept that something is true?

**God declared that** Abram was righteous God said that Abram was right and acceptable to God. This did not mean that Abram was sinless. Instead, it means that God said that Abram was upright because he believed in God. How would you express **God declared that** Abram was righteous to mean that God said that Abram was upright and acceptable to God?

#### 04-09

**covenant** God had already said he would give Canaan to Abram’s descendants (cf. 04:06). Now God stated the same thing again to Abram as an official promise. A **covenant** is a formal agreement between two parties that makes a promise official. What words in your language mean **covenant** as in a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill?

**from your own body** With his own body, Abram would cause his wife to become pregnant, so that, together, they would have their own, natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were very old. How would you express **from your own body** to mean Abram would have a son of his very own by his wife becoming pregnant?

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### At this point in human history, what were human beings like? (04-01, 04-02, 04-03)

Years after the flood, there were many people on the earth. Noah and his family had many children and grandchildren. (04-01)

People still disobeyed God and sinned against each other. God started his creation over with Noah. But humans were still sinful and continued to disobey God. (04-01)

All people spoke one language. Instead of spreading out over the earth like God commanded, the people gathered together and built a city. People were more interested in honoring themselves than honoring God. (04-01)

People were also very proud. They thought they were great and did not need to follow God’s commands. (04-02)

Humans tried to show how great they were by building a tower that reached up to heaven. Even though it is not possible to build a tower that reaches heaven, humans were so proud that they thought they could be as great as God. (04-02)

As long as humans were gathered together, they would do more and more evil. When humans don’t follow God’s commands, it also encourages others to not follow his commands. (04-02)

God was not pleased with people. God changed the languages of people so they could not understand each other and spread out over the earth. The place where this happened was called Babel. This means confused. The proud acts of people failed and brought confusion. (04-03)

##### How did God plan to restore his world? What promises did God give to Abram? (04-04, 04-05, 04-06, 04-08)

God made a promise to a man named Abram. His promise to Abram would be a way of blessing the world. (04-04)

God promised that he would give Abram the land of Canaan. God would lead Abram to this land. (04-04, 04-05, 04-06)

God promised that Abram would have a son. Through this son, Abram would have many descendants. His descendants would become as many as the stars in the sky. (04-04, 04-08)

God promised that Abram would become a great nation and have a great name/honor. Instead of people making themselves great like the humans did at Babel, only God can make people great. (04-04)

God promised to bless Abram. God also promised that he would bless the whole world because of Abram. (04-04)

##### How did Abram respond to God’s promise? (04-04, 04-05, 04-06, 04-07, 04-08, 04-09)

God told Abram to leave his country and family and travel to another land. Abram trusted God and obeyed his command. He left his land, traveled to Canaan, and settled there. (04-04, 04-05, 04-06)

God gave Abram victory in battle. Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of what he won in battle. Abram learned that all that he had came from God. Abram responded by generously giving a gift to Melchizedek. (04-07)

God promised Abram that he would give him a son. Abraham believed God’s promise and God saw him as righteous. (04-08)

God made a covenant with Abram as a way of showing that his promise would come true. God made this covenant while Abram was in a deep sleep. God does not depend upon humans to fulfill his promises. (04-09)
