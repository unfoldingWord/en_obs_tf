God wants his people to be unified and united (to function as one) and celebrate the diversity and uniqueness of individual members (who use their unique giftedness for the good of the community). In order to understand God's design of Christian community, read the passage below.

> 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body is not a single member, but many. 15 If the foot says, "Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it. 19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 So now they are many members, but only one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you." Nor does the head say to the feet, "I have no need of you." 22 But the members of the body that appear to be weaker are essential, 23 and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable, we give them greater honor, and our unpresentable members have more dignity. 24 Now our presentable members have no need to be treated with dignity, for they already have dignity. But God has joined all the members together, and he gave more honor to those that lacked it. 25 He did this so there may be no division within the body, but that the members should care for one another with the same affection. 26 So when one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

If one's gift is prophecy, let it be done according to the proportion of his faith. 7 If one's gift is service, let him serve. If one has the gift of teaching, let him teach. 8 If one's gift is encouragement, let him encourage. If one's gift is giving, let him do it generously.

#### Read the Passage (5 minutes)
Even though all Christians sometimes disobey God, true Christians no longer live a life characterized by sin. This means that Christians no longer live to please their sinful nature, but they walk by the Holy Spirit. When Christians follow the Holy Spirit, they can enjoy relationships with other believers in joy and peace. In order to understand what it means to walk by the Spirit, read the passage below.

> 19 Now the works of the sinful nature are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissension, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 23 gentleness, and self-control; against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. Galatians 5:19-26

#### Discuss the Idea (10–15 minutes)

4. How do these two (opposing) lists help you care for the community of believers?

#### Personal Prayer (5 minutes) (optional)

He grasped him, took him by the throat, and said, 'Pay me what you owe.' 29 But his fellow servant fell down and implored him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you.' 30 But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw him into prison until he should pay him what he owed. 31 When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were very upset. They came and told their master everything that had happened. 32 Then that servant's master called him, and said to him, 'You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you implored me. 33 Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?' 34 His master was angry and handed him over to the torturers until he would pay all that was owed. 35 So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."

Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the baptism with which I will be baptized?" 39 They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "The cup that I will drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you also will be baptized. 40 But who is to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." 41 When the other ten disciples heard about this, they began to be very angry with James and John. 42 Jesus called them to himself and said, "You know those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 But it shall not be this way among you. Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of all. 45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

> 6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ.

Instead, train yourself in godliness. 8 For bodily training is a little useful, but godliness is useful for all things. It holds promise for this life now and the life to come. 9 This message is trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance. 10 For it is for this that we struggle and work very hard. For we have hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, but especially of believers. 11 Proclaim and teach these things. 12 Let no one despise your youth. Instead, be an example for those who believe, in speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity. 13 Until I come, attend to the reading, to the exhortation, and to the teaching. 14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders. 15 Care for these things. Be in them, so that your progress may be evident to all people. 16 Give careful attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in these things. For by doing so, you will save yourself and those who listen to you. 1 Timothy 4:6-16

For I do not even judge myself. 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God. 6 Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written."

But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. 6 If I should choose to boast, I will not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me. 7 To keep me from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become overly proud. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me. 9 But he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me. 10 Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

He is the one who examines our hearts. 5 For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed—God is our witness. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ. 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. 8 In this way we had affection for you.

> 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth. 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey. 16 The one who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five talents. 17 Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two. 18 But the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them. 20 The servant who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five talents more.' 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.' 22 The servant who had received two talents came and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more talents.' 23 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.' 24 Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, 'Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter. 25 I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.' 26 But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered. 27 Therefore you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents. 29 For to everyone who possesses, more will be given—even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything, even what he does have will be taken away. 30 Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.' Matthew 25:14-30

Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be ashamed, who accurately teaches the word of truth. 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness. 17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some. 19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his" and "Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness." 20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. 21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work. 22 Flee youthful lusts. Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. 23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questions. You know that they give birth to arguments. 24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach, and patient. 25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth. 26 They may become sober again and leave the devil's trap, after they have been captured by him for his will. 2 Timothy 2:14-26

In order to understand God’s design of Christian community, read the passage below.

> 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body is not a single member, but many. 15 If the foot says, “Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body,” it is not any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it is not any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it. 19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 So now they are many members, but only one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you.” Nor does the head say to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 But the members of the body that appear to be weaker are essential, 23 and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable, we give them greater honor, and our unpresentable members have more dignity. 24 Now our presentable members have no need to be treated with dignity, for they already have dignity. But God has joined all the members together, and he gave more honor to those that lacked it. 25 He did this so there may be no division within the body, but that the members should care for one another with the same affection. 26 So when one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

God builds the Christian community with believers/Christians who are uniquely gifted.

In order to understand God’s design of Christian community, read the passage below.

Instead, they should think in a wise way, just as God has given out to each one a certain amount of faith. 4 For we have many members in one body, but not all the members have the same function. 5 In the same way, we who are many are one body in Christ, and are individually members of each other. 6 We have different gifts according to the grace that was given to us. If one’s gift is prophecy, let it be done according to the proportion of his faith. 7 If one’s gift is service, let him serve. If one has the gift of teaching, let him teach. 8 If one’s gift is encouragement, let him encourage. If one’s gift is giving, let him do it generously.

## Unit 5: Christlike Community: Embodying Godly Character in Our Relationships

Christian community thrives as disciples embody the character of Christ. God calls us to remove sinful vices that ruin community. He also calls us to develop godly characteristics that make community strong and enjoyable. Certainly, it is important to practice good habits as a community. But, it is also very important to develop godly character and attitudes. The Christian community will not only be strong by how we treat one another (i.e., what we do) but by the kind of people we are (i.e., who we are). This series of studies helps you *cultivate godly virtues that enable your relationships to thrive as a Christian community*.

Even though all Christians sometimes disobey God, true Christians no longer live a life characterized by sin.

When Christians follow the Holy Spirit, they can enjoy relationships with other believers in joy and peace. In order to understand what it means to walk by the Spirit, read the passage below.

> 19 Now the works of the sinful nature are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissension, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 23 gentleness, and self-control; against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. Galatians 5:19-26

They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and evil intentions. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventing ways of doing evil; they are disobedient to parents. 31 They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and unmerciful. 32 They understand the regulations of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death.

#### Read the Passage (5 minutes)

Even after we are saved, we will sin against others, and others will sin against us. God tells us to forgive others as he has forgiven us. In order to grow together as a united and one-minded community, read the passage below.

> 21 Then Peter came and said to Jesus, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Until seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “I do not tell you seven times, but until seventy times seven. 23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is similar to a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24 As he began the settling, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 25 But since he had not the means to repay, his master commanded him to be sold, together with his wife and children and everything that he had, and payment to be made. 26 So the servant fell down, bowed down before him, and said, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ 27 So the master of that servant, since he was moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. 28 But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii. He grasped him, took him by the throat, and said, ‘Pay me what you owe.’ 29 But his fellow servant fell down and implored him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you.’ 30 But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw him into prison until he should pay him what he owed. 31 When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were very upset. They came and told their master everything that had happened. 32 Then that servant’s master called him, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you implored me. 33 Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ 34 His master was angry and handed him over to the torturers until he would pay all that was owed. 35 So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.” Matthew 18:21-35

If he also refuses to listen to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven. 19 Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.” Matthew 18:15-20

After he entered the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another on the way about who was the greatest. 35 Sitting down, he called the twelve together and he said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” Mark 9:31-35

Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the baptism with which I will be baptized?” 39 They said to him, “We are able.” Jesus said to them, “The cup that I will drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you also will be baptized. 40 But who is to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 41 When the other ten disciples heard about this, they began to be very angry with James and John. 42 Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 But it shall not be this way among you.

For I do not even judge myself. 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God. 6 Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” This is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other. 1 Corinthians 4:1-7

But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. 6 If I should choose to boast, I will not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me. 7 To keep me from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become overly proud. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me. 9 But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me. 10 Therefore I am content for Christ’s sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts. 5 For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed—God is our witness. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ. 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. 8 In this way we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us. 1 Thessalonians 2:1-8

Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey. 16 The one who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five talents. 17 Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two. 18 But the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them. 20 The servant who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents. He said, ‘Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 The servant who had received two talents came and said, ‘Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more talents.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 24 Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, ‘Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter. 25 I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.’ 26 But his master answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered. 27 Therefore you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents. 29 For to everyone who possesses, more will be given—even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything, even what he does have will be taken away. 30 Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ Matthew 25:14-30

Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be ashamed, who accurately teaches the word of truth. 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness. 17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some. 19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness.” 20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. 21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work. 22 Flee youthful lusts. Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. 23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questions. You know that they give birth to arguments. 24 The Lord’s servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach, and patient. 25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth. 26 They may become sober again and leave the devil’s trap, after they have been captured by him for his will. 2 Timothy 2:14-26
