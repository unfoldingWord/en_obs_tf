There was a man named Lazarus. He had two sisters named Mary and Martha. They were all close friends of Jesus. One day someone told Jesus that Lazarus was very sick. When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not end with Lazarus dying. Instead, it will cause people to honor God.”

##### 37-02

![](.\assets\images\image427.jpeg)

Jesus loved his friends, but he waited where he was for two days. After those two days, he said to his disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.” “But Teacher,” the disciples answered, “just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Jesus said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.”

##### 37-03

![](.\assets\images\image428.jpeg)

Jesus’ disciples replied, “Master, if Lazarus is sleeping, then he will get better.” Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe in me.”

##### 37-04

![](.\assets\images\image429.jpeg)

When Jesus arrived at Lazarus’ hometown, Lazarus had already been dead for four days. Martha went out to meet Jesus and said, “Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I believe God will give you whatever you ask from him.”

##### 37-05

![](.\assets\images\image430.jpeg)

Jesus replied, “I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. Everyone who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” Martha answered, “Yes, Master! I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”

##### 37-06

![](.\assets\images\image431.jpeg)

Then Mary arrived. She fell at the feet of Jesus and said, “Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.” Jesus asked them, “Where have you put Lazarus?” They told him, “In the tomb. Come and see.” Then Jesus wept.

##### 37-07

![](.\assets\images\image432.jpeg)

The tomb was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When Jesus arrived at the tomb, he told them, “Roll the stone away.” But Martha said, “He has been dead for four days. There will be a bad smell.”

##### 37-08

![](.\assets\images\image433.jpeg)

Jesus answered, “Did I not tell you that you would see God’s power if you believe in me?” So they rolled the stone away.

Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, thank you for hearing me. I know you always listen to me, but I say this in order to help all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me.” Then Jesus shouted, “Lazarus, come out!”

##### 37-10

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 37-01

**This sickness will not end with Lazarus dying** Lazarus was very sick. Jesus said that his sickness would not ultimately end up in death. Jesus’ disciples probably thought this meant that Lazarus would not die. But Jesus knew that, although Lazarus would die from his sickness, he would live in the end. How would you express **This sickness will not end with Lazarus dying** to mean the final result of this sickness will not be the death of Lazarus?

**Instead, it will cause people to honor God** The final result of Lazarus’ sickness would not be death. A very different result would take place. Lazarus’ sickness would be used to cause people to praise God. How would you express **Instead, it will cause people to honor God** to mean Lazarus’ sickness would result in people praising God rather than Lazarus ultimately dying?

#### 37-02

**Jesus loved his friends** Jesus considered Lazarus and his sisters (Mary and Martha) friends. He felt a deep affection for them as friends. How would you express **Jesus loved his friends** to mean Jesus cared deeply for Lazarus, Mary, and Martha?

**but he waited where he was for two days** Jesus deeply loved Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. Typically, people would visit a sick friend as soon as possible. Instead of visiting Lazarus immediately, Jesus stayed two extra days. This seems different/opposite to how friends would care for each other. This does not mean that Jesus did not care for Lazarus and his sisters. Jesus delayed visiting Lazarus, knowing he would do a miracle to bring him back from the dead. How would you express **but he waited where he was for two days** to mean Jesus stayed where he was for two days, even though Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters?

**just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!** The disciples were concerned that Jesus would return to a place where people wanted to kill him. The disciples said this to emphasize the great danger Jesus faced if he went to Judea. How would you express **just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!** as a strong statement showing concern for Jesus’ safety by warning him of the danger he would face if he returned to Judea?

**has fallen asleep** When a person dies, it looks like they have fallen asleep. This is a polite way of saying that Lazarus has died. Although Jesus was using this word with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet. How would you express **has fallen asleep** as a polite way of saying someone has died?

**I must wake him** Jesus described bringing Lazarus back to life as waking him up from sleep. Lazarus was not really sleeping. He actually died. Jesus was using this to say that he would make Lazarus alive again. Although Jesus was using this word with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet. How would you express **I must wake him** to mean Jesus would bring Lazarus back to life, similar to waking someone up who is sleeping?

#### 37-03

**if Lazarus is sleeping, then he will get better** The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was actually sleeping. In reality, Lazarus had died. The disciples did not yet understand what had happened. How would you express **if Lazarus is sleeping, then he will get better** to mean there is no reason for us to go to him now since he will get well?

**I am glad that I was not there** Jesus was not happy that Lazarus died, but rather he was happy that God was going to show how great he is. How would you express **I am glad that I was not there** to mean Jesus was happy that he was not there to heal Lazarus when he was sick because now God would show his great power by bringing Lazarus back to life?

**so that you may believe in me** Jesus was happy for the chance to show God’s power in bringing Lazarus back to life. The purpose of this miracle was to cause people to trust Jesus. How would you express **so that you may believe in me** to mean that Jesus wanted to show God’s power and bring Lazarus back to life to cause people to place their faith in Jesus?

#### 37-04

**if only you had been here, my brother would not have died** Martha is stating a hypothetical situation—what could have happened if Jesus had not waited for Lazarus to die before he came? Martha is describing something that did not happen but could have happened. Martha believed that if Jesus returned when Lazarus was sick, he would have healed him, and he would not have died. How would you express **if only you had been here, my brother would not have died** to mean Martha believed that if Jesus had returned earlier, he could have prevented Lazarus from dying?

**will give you whatever you ask from him** Martha was convinced that God the Father would grant any request that Jesus asked. How would you express **will give you whatever you ask from him** to mean Martha believed that God would do whatever Jesus asked him to do?

#### 37-05

**I am the Resurrection and the Life** This is one of several very powerful I am statements in which Jesus says something about his essential nature. In this one, Jesus indicates that he is the provider or source of resurrection and life. How would you express **I am the** Resurrection and the Life to mean Jesus is the one who resurrects people (brings people back to life after they die) and causes them to live?

**will live, even though he dies** Jesus is saying something surprising. Usually, when people die, they are no longer alive. However, Jesus is able to bring people back to life. Therefore, Jesus explained that every person who trusts in Jesus would live forever even though they would die. How would you express **will live, even though he dies** to mean people who trust in Jesus will live forever even though they die because Jesus has the power to bring dead people back to life?

**will never die** Jesus is explaining what will ultimately happen to people. People who trust in Jesus will physically die, but Jesus has the power to bring them back to life. So, even though they die, they don’t finally stay dead. How would you express **will never die** to mean every person who believes in Jesus will never finally stay dead because Jesus will bring them back to life and cause them to live forever?

#### 37-06

**fell at the feet of Jesus** Mary got on her knees before Jesus so that she was on the ground near his feet. This was a sign of honor and reverence. How would you express **fell at the feet of** Jesus to mean Mary knelt down at Jesus’ feet as a sign of respect?

**if only you had been here, my brother would not have died** Mary is stating a hypothetical situation—what could have happened if Jesus had not waited for Lazarus to die before he came? Mary is describing something that did not happen but could have happened. Mary believed that if Jesus returned when Lazarus was sick, he would have healed him, and he would not have died. How would you express **if only you had been here, my brother would not have died** to mean Mary believed that if Jesus had returned earlier, he could have prevented Lazarus from dying?

**Then Jesus wept** Jesus mourned Lazarus’ death by crying. This showed that Jesus loved Lazarus and grieved his death. How would you express **Then** Jesus wept to mean Jesus expressed his grief and sadness by crying?

#### 37-07

**Roll the stone away** Jesus gave instructions for the stone to be moved away from the entrance of the tomb. How would you express **Roll the stone away** as a command to push/roll the stone away from the opening of the tomb?

**He has been dead for four days** At this point, Lazarus had been dead for four days. This means that his body would start decaying and give off a smell. How would you express **He has been dead for four days** to mean Lazarus died four days ago, and his body is lying there?

#### 37-08

**Did I not tell you that you would see God’s power if you believe in me?** Jesus is asking this question but is not looking for an answer or information. Jesus asked the question to show that people did not fully believe Jesus and did not understand what he was about to do. He wanted to remind them that if they believed in Jesus, they would see God do powerful things. How would you express **Did I not tell you that you would see God’s power if you believe in me?** as a question in which Jesus is telling people to remember that Jesus told them that they would see God show how powerful he is if they believed/trusted in Jesus?

#### 37-09

**hearing me** Jesus prayed to God the Father, and God the Father answered Jesus’ prayers. How would you express **hearing me** to mean Jesus is thanking God the Father for listening to him when he prays to him?

**Lazarus, come out!** Jesus spoke to Lazarus and commanded him to come out of the tomb. How would you express **Lazarus, come out!** as a strong command for Lazarus to walk out of the tomb on his own?

#### 37-10

**Lazarus came out!** Those watching did not expect Lazarus to come back to life. Now they saw him walking out of the tomb. This was a surprise and a shock. How would you express **Lazarus came out!** as a strong statement emphasizing the shocking fact that Lazarus, who had been dead, walked out of the tomb?

**He was still wrapped in grave clothes** At this time, people wrapped a dead body in strips of cloth and placed them in a tomb. Lazarus went directly from being dead to walking out of the tomb at Jesus’ command. He walked out of the tomb and still had burial bandages on. How would you express **He was still wrapped in grave clothes** to mean Lazarus walked out of the tomb and was still covered in his burial clothes?

**Many of the Jews believed in Jesus because of this miracle** After Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, many Jewish people put their trust in Jesus. How would you express **Many of the Jews believed in Jesus because of this miracle** to mean the reason many Jewish people put their faith in Jesus (trusted him as the Messiah) was God had done this amazing miracle and had made Lazarus come alive again?

#### 37-11

**envied** The religious leaders were jealous of Jesus. Many people were following Jesus, and the religious leaders wanted people to follow them. How would you express **envied** to mean the Jewish religious leaders were jealous of Jesus’ power and popularity and that so many Jews believed in Jesus?

**gathered together** The religious leaders met together to figure out how to kill Jesus. This was not a casual meeting but a meeting for a specific purpose to plan how to kill Jesus. How would you express **gathered together** to mean to assemble together and join together for a purpose?

#### Record Translation Decisions

*As a community, discuss some of the most noteworthy translation decisions in your draft. Summarize each decision and explain the reasons your community decided on that translation. You should update these decisions each time you check your draft with various groups of people.*

You should **measure** the quality of your translation draft. You can **record translation decisions** to make it clear why you translated things a certain way. Translation decisions can help your translation team and the surrounding community be a part of the translation process.

How can you know the quality of your translation?

1.  **Measure** the translation by marks/standards of quality (i.e., clear, accurate, natural, church-approved)
2.  **Test** the translation with others and record feedback and conversations from in the field (i.e., church and community check)
3.  **Compare** and **contrast** the translation with the source text (i.e., meaning of text and notes) and alternatives (i.e., other translation choices)
4.  **Explain** the reasons why you translated a particular portion of the text.

**Example Sentences That Help Explain Your Translation Decision**
Use the following example sentences to help explain your translation decisions:

1.  The original text literally **says/means**, so we translated the term in this way…
2.  We originally decided to translate **the biblical term** with **this term**, but we changed it because…
3.  When our translation team discussed **the biblical term**, this is what we talked about…
4.  **The term** is \[clear, accurate, natural, consistent\] because…
5.  The community understands **this term** to mean…
6.  We considered these other terms. We did not use **these terms** because…
7.  When we checked this in the church, we learned…
8.  When we checked this in the community, we learned…

**Example of Translation Decision**

In OBS 01-07 we decided to translate **blessed** like this: \[actual translation\]. We decided on this translation because of these reasons:

1.  The word \[actual translation\] means to cause good things to happen to someone or something. This term is used when a person desires someone or something to prosper or flourish. This term does not refer to magic or witchcraft.
2.  When we checked this word with other believers, they said it describes God showing his kindness and favor on someone or something. These are some of the terms that we did not decide to use…
3.  Many of our people will understand this word. When we discussed this phrase with the surrounding community, we discovered it was a natural way to describe God causing good and beneficial things to happen.

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check your draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identify how each specific phrase was translated into your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
