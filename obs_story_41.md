After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the Jewish leaders said to Pilate, “That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. Someone must guard the tomb to make sure that his disciples do not steal the body. If they do, they will say he has risen from the dead.”

##### 41-02

![](.\assets\images\image474.jpeg)

Pilate said, “Take some soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you can.” So they placed a seal on the stone at the entrance of the tomb. They also put soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

##### 41-03

![](.\assets\images\image475.jpeg)

The day after Jesus died was a Sabbath day. No one could work on the Sabbath day, so no friends of Jesus went to his tomb. But on the day after the Sabbath, very early in the morning, several women got ready to go to Jesus’ tomb. They wanted to put more spices on his body.

##### 41-04

![](.\assets\images\image476.jpeg)

Before the women arrived, there was a great earthquake at the tomb. An angel came from heaven. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. This angel was shining as brightly as lightning. The soldiers at the tomb saw him. They were so terrified that they fell to the ground like dead men.

##### 41-05

![](.\assets\images\image477.jpeg)

When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus’ body had been laid. His body was not there!

##### 41-06

![](.\assets\images\image478.jpeg)

Then the angel told the women, “Go and tell the disciples, ‘Jesus has risen from the dead and he will go to Galilee ahead of you.’”

##### 41-07

![](.\assets\images\image479.jpeg)

The women were amazed and very joyful. They ran to tell the disciples the good news.

##### 41-08

![](.\assets\images\image480.jpeg)

As the women were on their way to tell the disciples the good news, Jesus appeared to them. They bowed down at his feet. Then Jesus said, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples to go to Galilee. They will see me there.”

#### 41-01

**After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the Jewish leaders said to Pilate** The soldiers crucified Jesus. Then, the Jewish leaders spoke to Pilate to ask him to guard the tomb. How would you express **After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the Jewish leaders said to Pilate** to mean the Jewish leaders spoke to Pilate after he had had Jesus crucified?

**That liar Jesus, said,** The Jewish leaders called Jesus a liar. Jesus was telling the truth, but the Jewish leaders did not believe him. They refused to believe that Jesus told the truth about being the Son of God. How would you express **That liar Jesus, said,** to mean that man, Jesus, lied and said?

**rise from the dead** Jesus predicted that he would come back to life again after he had died. His resurrection from the dead is a miracle. How would you express **rise from the dead** to mean come back to life or become alive again?

**If they do, they will say he has risen from the dead** The Jewish leaders were concerned that the disciples would steal Jesus’ body from the tomb to make it seem like Jesus rose from the dead. How would you express **If they do, they will say he has risen from the dead** to mean the Jewish leaders thought that the disciples would only be able to say Jesus had risen from the dead if they were able to steal his body?

#### 41-02

**Take some soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you can** Pilate instructed them to instruct some soldiers to watch over the tomb. He told them that these soldiers should guard the tomb as effectively as they were able to in order to prevent anyone from stealing Jesus’ body. How would you express **Take some soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you can** to mean order some soldiers to watch over the tomb and do their best to prevent anyone from stealing Jesus’ body?

**they placed a seal on the stone** The religious leaders and the soldiers placed a mark on the stone that covered the entrance of the tomb. They put a soft material like clay or wax between the stone and the tomb and marked it with an official seal. If anyone moved the stone, the material would break and show someone had entered the tomb. How would you express **they placed a seal on the stone** to mean a mark on the stone in front of the tomb to forbid people from moving the stone?

#### 41-03

**No one could work on the Sabbath day** The Sabbath day rules did not permit a Jew to walk very far or do any other work. How would you express **No one could work on the Sabbath day** to mean, according to Jewish law, Jews were not permitted to work on the Sabbath day, which included prohibiting Jews from walking a far distance?

**put more spices on his body** These spices refer to sweet-smelling herbs that were placed on a dead body to cover the bad smell. It was the custom of the Jews to wash the body and then wrap it with strong, pleasant smelling spices to prevent the dead body from smelling bad so quickly. This was also a sign of honor and devotion. How would you express **put more spices on his body** to mean the women wanted to put sweet-smelling herbs or oils on Jesus’ body to keep the body from smelling bad?

#### 41-04

**Before the women arrived, there was a great earthquake at the tomb** First, there was the earthquake and the appearance of the angel, and then the women arrived at the tomb. An earthquake causes the ground to shake violently.

How would you express **fell to the ground like dead men** to mean the soldiers suddenly collapsed to the ground and did not move like dead people who are motionless?

#### 41-05

**When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them** These two events happened at the same time. The women arrived at the tomb, and the angel spoke to them at the same moment. How would you express **When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them** to mean the angel spoke to the womb at the time they arrived at the tomb?

**Do not be afraid** The angel instructed the women not to fear. An angel shining like lightning was a frightening sight, so that angel was trying to calm the women from being terrified. How would you express **Do not be afraid** as a command to stop being scared?

**He has risen from the dead** The angel told the women that Jesus had resurrected from the dead. How would you express **He has risen from the dead** to mean Jesus has come back to life?

**His body was not there!** The women did not find Jesus’ body in the tomb. This was a great surprise. How would you express **His body was not there!** as a strong statement that emphasizes how surprised they were that the body of Jesus was no longer in the tomb?

#### 41-06

**Go and tell the disciples** The angel instructed the women to leave the tomb area and report to the disciples that Jesus had risen from the dead. How would you express **Go and tell the disciples** as a command to depart from the tomb and inform the disciples that Jesus had come back to life?

**Jesus has risen from the dead** The angel instructed the women to tell the disciples that Jesus had come back to life. Jesus was among those who died and were no longer alive, but God’s power caused Jesus to come to life again. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To rise from among them speaks of becoming alive again. How would you express **Jesus has risen from the dead** to mean Jesus came back to life from among all those who have died?

**he will go to Galilee ahead of you** The angel said that Jesus would arrive in Galilee before the apostles and other disciples. Jesus would meet the apostles and disciples in Galilee when they arrived.

#### 41-07

**the good news** The women went to tell the disciples that Jesus had risen from the dead. This was very good news to report to the disciples and would bring great joy. How would you express **the good news** to mean the exciting message that Jesus was no longer dead but had come back to life?

#### 41-08

**bowed down at his feet** The women fell down on the ground in front of Jesus. They did this symbolic action to honor Jesus as they would expect to do in the presence of a king. How would you express **bowed down at his feet** to mean the women lowered their bodies on the ground in front of Jesus as an act of honor and respect?

**will see me** At this point, the disciples knew that Jesus died. Jesus told the women that the disciples would see Jesus in Galilee. This would help the disciples believe that Jesus really did come back to life. How would you express **will see me** to mean the disciples would meet with Jesus in person and see that he had come back to life?
