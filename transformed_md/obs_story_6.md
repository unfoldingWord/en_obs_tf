### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### How did provide a wife for Isaac? (06-01, 06-02, 06-03)

Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land of his relatives to find a wife for his son Isaac. Abraham wanted Isaac to marry someone who would share his faith and values. God used Abraham’s faithfulness to provide for Isaac. (06-01)

God led Abraham’s servant to Rebekah. The servant did not discover Rebekah himself. God guided the servant to find Rebekah. (06-02)

Rebekah was the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother. One way the servant knew that this choice was from God was because Rebekah was a part of Abraham’s extended family. God honored Abraham’s desire to find an appropriate wife for Isaac and provided a woman from his extended family. (06-02)

Rebekah agreed to go back with the servant to Isaac’s home. God worked in Rebekah to agree to go. She was not forced to go. (06-03)

Isaac married Rebekah when she arrived. Even though God used people—Abraham, the servant, Rebekah—God brought about the circumstances to provide a wife for Isaac. (06-03)

##### How did God provide a child for Isaac and Rebekah? (06-04, 06-05, 06-06, 06-07)

God promised that Abraham would have countless descendants. Rebekah was barren and was not able to have children. God’s promise gave confidence that Isaac and Rebekah would have a child. (06-04)

Isaac prayed for Rebekah. God answered the prayer and caused Rebekah to become pregnant with twins (06-05)

God told Rebekah that she would give birth to two sons. He explained that these sons would have many descendants and would each become a nation. God provided children who would become numerous nations. (06-06)

Eventually, Rebekah gave birth to her two children. Just like God provided a wife for Isaac, he also provided children for Isaac and Rebekah. (06-07)

##### How did God keep the promises of his covenant? (06-04, 06-06, 06-07)

God blessed Isaac because of his covenant with Abraham. God kept his promise to Abraham across generations. (06-04)

Each of these children would have many descendants which would become nations. (06-06)

God would cause the older son to serve the younger son. Even though the custom of the day would have the younger son serve the older son, God would cause the older son to serve the younger son. God was choosing which line of descendants he would continue his covenant. (06-06)

The two sons and their descendants would be in conflict with one another. God would fulfill the promises of his covenant even though there would be conflict among humans. Human conflict would not deter God’s covenant promises from being fulfilled. (06-07)
