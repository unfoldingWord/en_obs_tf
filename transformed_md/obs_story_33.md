![](.\assets\images\image387.jpeg)

One day, Jesus was near the shore of the lake. He was teaching a very large crowd of people. So many people came to hear him that Jesus did not have enough room to speak to them all. So he got into a boat in the water. There he sat and taught the people.

##### 33-02

![](.\assets\images\image388.jpeg)

Jesus told this story. “A farmer went out to plant some seed. As he was spreading the seed by hand, some of the seed happened to fall on the path. But birds came and ate all of that seed.”

##### 33-03

![](.\assets\images\image389.jpeg)

“Other seed fell on rocky ground, where there was very little soil. The seed in the rocky ground sprouted quickly, but its roots were not able to go deep into the soil. When the sun came up and it got hot, the plants withered and died.”

##### 33-04

![](.\assets\images\image390.jpeg)

“Still other seed fell among thorn bushes. This seed began to grow, but the thorns choked it out. So the plants that grew from the seed in the thorny ground did not produce any grain.”

##### 33-05

![](.\assets\images\image391.jpeg)

“Other seed fell into good soil. This seed grew up and produced 30, 60, or even 100 times as much grain as the seed that had been planted. Whoever wants to follow God, let him pay attention to what I am saying!”

##### 33-06

![](.\assets\images\image392.jpeg)

This story confused the disciples. So Jesus explained, “The seed is the word of God. The path is a person who hears God’s word, but does not understand it. Then the devil takes the word away from him. That is, the devil keeps him from understanding it.”

##### 33-07

![](.\assets\images\image393.jpeg)

“The rocky ground is a person who hears God’s word and accepts it with joy. But when he suffers hardships, or when other people make him suffer, he falls away from God. That is, he stops trusting in God.”

##### 33-08

![](.\assets\images\image394.jpeg)

“The thorny ground is a person who hears God’s word. But he begins to worry about many things, and he tries to make a lot of money, and he tries to get many things. After some time, he is not able to love God any longer. So what he learned from God’s word does not make him able to please God. He is like wheat stalks that do not produce any grain.”

##### 33-09

“But the seed in the good soil is a person who hears the word of God, believes it, and produces fruit.”

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### How did Jesus use the story of the farmer to teach God’s word/truth? (33-01, 33-02, 33-05)

Crowd: Jesus was teaching a large crowd of people near the shore of a lake. There were so many people that Jesus had to get into a boat and teach the crowd from the water. Jesus taught these people what it means to really follow God. Not everyone in the crowd followed Jesus. Jesus was using the story to teach people about what it meant to truly follow God. (33-01)

Seed Like Word of God: Just like Jesus was teaching the crowd, Jesus told a story of a farmer who cast seed on the ground. The farmer was planting crops. Jesus was teaching God’s word. The same seed was spread on the ground and Jesus’ same teaching was shared with all the people listening to him. When the seed fell on different soil, there were different results. When different people heard God’s word, they received Jesus’ teaching differently like the different soils in the story. Jesus was using the story to tell people the truth of God’s word: (33-02, 33-06)

Pay Attention: At the end of the story, Jesus told people to pay attention to what he said if they really wanted to follow God. The story taught about a spiritual reality of what it mean to follow Jesus. True followers of Jesus will focus on what Jesus says, believe it, and practice it in their lives. (33-05)

Explanation: Jesus took time to explain the parable to his disciples. At first, they did not understand what Jesus was saying after he finished telling the story. They were confused. He explained how the seed represented the word of God. Jesus explained how different soils in the story represented how different kinds of people respond differently to Gods word. (33-06).

##### What does the seed which fell on the path teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-02, 33-06)

Path: Some people respond to God’s word like seed that falls on a path. The soil of the path is not great soil to grow crops. Birds can easily eat the seed before it has time to grow. Some people hear God’s word and they do not accept it. (33-02)

No Truth: The path represents a person who hears God’s word but does not understand it. The devil works to try to keep people from understanding God’s word. Like the birds that ate the seed on the path before the seeds could turn into plants, the devil tries to steal/take God’s word from people so they do not understand what it says. People who are ignorant of God’s word cannot truly follow Jesus. (33-06)

##### What does the seed which fell on the rocky ground teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-03, 33-07)

Rocky Ground: Some people respond to God’s word like seed that falls on rocky ground. On rocky ground there is very little soil. The seed can sprout quickly on this ground but it is not able to have deep roots. As a result, the plant which sprouted fast eventually dies and withers when the heat of the sun comes out. Some people accept God’s word with joy and then stop believing when it gets difficult. (33-03)

No Roots: The rocky ground represents a person who hears God’s word and joyfully believes it. They begin believing God’s word with joy and excitement. However, this person experiences hardships/misfortunes and other people persecute/mistreat them because they have believed God’s word. This hardship is like the heat of the sun that withered the seed that grew in rocky soil. These people do not have deep roots and do not endure the hardship. They give up and stop trusting in God. People need deep roots of faith to follow God. (33-07)

##### What does the seed which fell on the thorny ground teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-04, 33-08)

Thorny Ground: Some people respond to God’s word like seed that falls on ground full of thorn bushes. The seed grows but the thorns crowd out the plant and keep it from growing. These plants do not grow any grain. Some people hear accept God’s word but others circumstances prevent their faith from growing and producing fruit. (33-04)

No Fruit: The thorny ground represents a person who hears and accepts God’s word. This person begins to grow in the faith. However, the desires of the world cause this person to be more focused on the things of the world more than God. This person worries about money and possessions and eventually does not loved and please God anymore. This person grows a little but does not produce any fruit. That is, this person does show evidence in their life that God is at work. People who truly follow God will show fruit in their lives. (33-08)

##### What does the seed which fell on the good soil teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-05, 33-09)

Good Soil: Some people respond to God’s word like seed that falls on ground that is fertile. This soil causes the seed to grow and produce a lot of crops. (33-05)

Fruit: Some people hear God’s word and truly accept it. These people grow in their faith, continue to follow Jesus, love God above all, and show evidence of Gods’ work in their life. (33-09)
