### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 25-01

**Immediately after Jesus was baptized** In the previous story, Jesus was baptized. Right after Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness. How would you translate **Immediately after Jesus was baptized** to mean the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness directly after Jesus was baptized.

**the Holy Spirit led him** The Holy Spirit guided Jesus to go into the wilderness. How would you express **the Holy Spirit led him** to mean the Holy Spirit guided him or prompted him to go?

**the wilderness** Jesus went into a remote, barren place with few people. This place probably had very few trees or other plants, so most people would not be able to live there. How would you express **the wilderness** to mean a remote, desert-like place where few people lived?

**tempted him to sin** Satan tried to persuade Jesus to disobey God. Since Jesus did not sin, this word does not imply that Satan succeeded in convincing Jesus to sin, only that he tried to get Jesus to sin. How would you express **tempted him to sin** to mean tried to convince him to sin?

#### 25-02

**If you are the Son of God** Satan knew that Jesus was indeed the Son of God. Jesus also knew he was indeed the Son of God. Satan was saying this to try to get Jesus to prove he is truly the Son of God in a way that would cause Jesus to sin. How would you express **If you are the Son of God** to mean since it is true that you are the Son of God?

**turn these rocks into bread** Satan tempted Jesus to prove he is the Son of God by supernaturally changing rocks into bread. In the Jews’ culture, bread was the main/staple food. How would you express **turn these rocks into bread** to mean make these rocks become bread/food?

**so you can eat** Satan asked Jesus to turn rocks into bread. During Jesus’ time in the wilderness, he was fasting and grew hungry. The purpose of turning rocks into bread would be for Jesus to eat and satisfy his hunger. So, Satan tempted Jesus to prove he was the Son of God by making food for himself out of rocks and satisfying his hunger. How would you express **so you can eat** to mean the purpose of turning rocks into bread was that Jesus could satisfy his hunger by eating food?

#### 25-03

**It is written** Jesus quoted a portion of God’s word. This was a passage written and recorded in the Scriptures. How would you express **It is written** to mean God’s word says or God says in his word?

**People do not only need bread** Jesus affirms that food is necessary to live. However, Jesus also says that bread/food is not the only thing people need to live. How would you express **People do not only need bread** to mean people need more than just physical food to live?

**but they need everything that God tells them!** Although Jesus acknowledges that people need bread to live, he says that people need more than just bread. People live by following God’s word. How would you express **but they need everything that God tells them!** to mean rather than just surviving by physical food, people need to listen to and obey everything God says to live?

#### 25-04

**jump off to the ground** Satan tempted Jesus to leap off of the top of the Temple toward the ground. How would you express **jump off to the ground** to mean to leap off the building to the ground?

**so your foot does not hit a stone** Satan quotes a passage of God’s word. This passage says God would send angels to protect a person from injury. In this passage the angels would carry him so that even your foot will not strike against a stone and would not be injured. How would you express **so your foot does not hit a stone** to mean so that you will not be hurt at all and not even your foot will be injured on a stone?

#### 25-05

**God tells everyone** Jesus responded to Satan by telling Satan a command that God gives to everyone. God prohibits anyone form testing God. How would you express **God tells everyone** to mean this is what God says to everyone?

**Do not test the Lord your God** God prohibits people from challenging God to take care of them when they do not even obey God. How would you express **Do not test the Lord your God** as a command to not challenge the Lord your God to prove himself to you?

**the Lord your God** Yahweh is the one and only God. Even if people do not believe and follow Yahweh, he is still Lord and God. Yahweh is Lord and God of all peoples and places. However, Yahweh is specifically the Lord of his people when **the**y trust and obey him. How would you express **the Lord your God** to mean Yahweh, your God who has authority over you?

#### 25-06

**the kingdoms of the world** Satan showed Jesus all the domains of power and human government on the earth. How would you express **the kingdoms of the world** to mean all the greatest cities, countries, and other territories of the world where humans exercise authority/government?

**I will give you all this** Satan told Jesus that he would make Jesus the ruler over all these countries, cities and people if Jesus worshiped Satan. How would you express **I will give you all this** to mean to give him all the wealth and power of these kingdoms on the earth?

**bow down** Satan asked Jesus to lower himself to the ground. This act symbolized reverence, honor, and devotion. Satan wanted Jesus to worship him. How would you express **bow down** to mean to lower oneself to the ground in act of worship and devotion?

#### 25-07

**Get away from me** Jesus commanded Satan to leave his presence. How would you express **Get away from me** as a command for Satan to leave Jesus alone and go away from Jesus?

**Worship only the Lord your God** Jesus quotes a command from God’s word. This command instructs people to praise, serve, and submit themselves only to Yahweh as God. How would you express **Worship only the Lord your God** as a command to be devoted only to Yahweh as God who has authority over your life?

**Honor only him as God** Jesus quotes a command from God’s word. This command instructs people to only respect, praise, and revere Yahweh as God. How would you express **Honor only him as God** as a command to only respect and revere Yahweh as God?

#### 25-08

**did not give in to** Jesus did not do what Satan asked. In each temptation, Jesus refused to do what Satan wanted him to do. How would you express **did not give in to** to mean Jesus did not do the things that Satan was tempting him to do?

**so Satan left him** Jesus did not do the things Satan tempted him to do. The result of this was Satan left Jesus alone. How would you express **so Satan left him** to mean the result of Jesus not doing the things Satan tempted him to do was Satan left Jesus alone and no longer tempted him at that moment?
