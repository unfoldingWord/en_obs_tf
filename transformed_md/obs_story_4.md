### Open Bible Story: God’s Covenant with Abraham

######### 04-01

![](\images\image46.jpeg)

Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they still sinned against God and each other. Because they all spoke the same language, they gathered together and built a city instead of spreading out over the earth as God had commanded.

######### 04-02

![](\images\image47.jpeg)

They were very proud, and they did not want to obey God’s commands about how they should live. They even began building a tall tower that would reach heaven. God saw that, if they all kept working together to do evil, they could do many more sinful things.

######### 04-03

![](\images\image48.jpeg)

So God changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

######### 04-04

![](\images\image49.jpeg)

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All families on earth will be blessed because of you.”

######### 04-05

![](\images\image50.jpeg)

So Abram obeyed God. He took his wife, Sarai, together with all of his servants and everything he owned and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.

######### 04-06

![](\images\image51.jpeg)

When Abram arrived in Canaan, God said, “Look all around you. I will give to you all this land, and your descendants will always possess it.” Then Abram settled in the land.

######### 04-07

![](\images\image52.jpeg)

There was a man named Melchizedek who was a priest of God Most High. One day, after Abram had been in a battle, he and Abram met. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had won in the battle.

######### 04-08

![](\images\image53.jpeg)

Many years went by, but Abram and Sarai still did not have a son. God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God’s promise. God declared that Abram was righteous because he believed in God’s promise.

######### 04-09

![](\images\image54.jpeg)

Then God made a covenant with Abram. Normally, a covenant is an agreement between two parties to do things for each other. But in this case, God made a promise to Abram while Abram was in a deep sleep, but he could still hear God. God said, “I will give you a son from your own body. I give the land of Canaan to your descendants.” But Abram still did not have a son.

### Translation Questions

**gathered together** The people at this time came together and stayed close to one another. God commanded humans to spread out over the earth. How would you phrase **gathered together** to mean people came together into one area?

**a city** A city is a place where a lot of people live and work close together. It is a large town. What words in your language mean **a city** as in place where many people live and work in a similar area?

#### 04-02

**very proud** The people thought very highly about themselves. A proud person often does not admit his own faults and thinks he is better than others. He is not humble. How would you translate **very proud** to mean the people thought very highly of themselves and considered themselves to be very great?

**a tall tower that would reach heaven** This structure was so tall that its top would be in the sky. How would you express **a tall tower that would reach heaven** to mean a tall building that would be as high as the sky?

#### 04-03

**changed their language** In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that, suddenly, they were no longer able to understand each other. How would you express **changed their language** to mean God made the people speak in different languages?

**spread the people** When God changed their languages, he caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth. Each group moved to its own area. How would you express **spread the people** to mean God caused the people to move and live in different places?

**confused** The name of the city was called Babel. This word in Hebrew sounds like the word for **confused**. To be **confused** means to be unable to understand what someone is saying. When God changed the languages of the people, they were unable to understand each other. What words in your language mean **confused** as in to mixed-up or unable to understand?

#### 04-04

How would you translate **will make your name great** to mean God would cause Abram and his family to be well-known throughout the world and people would think well of them?

#### 04-05

**obeyed** To obey means to follow someone’s commands. Abram did what God told him to. What words in your language me **obeyed** as in to follow the orders or instructions of someone else?

**God showed him** Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was to go. The text doesn’t tell how **God showed him**. How would you express **God showed him** to mean that God made it clear and obvious where Abram should go?

#### 04-06

**possess** To **possess** the land means to own the land and dwell in it. God promised to give the land to Abram and also to his descendants. He promised they would own it and dwell in it forever. How would you express **possess** to mean that they would own the land of Canaan as a place to live?

**settled** Abram and his family lived in the land of Canaan. To settle means to stay in a place where one lives. What words in your language mean **settled** as in to live in a place by dwelling there?

#### 04-07

**priest** A **priest** is someone God has chosen to offer sacrifices to God on behalf of God’s people. Priests also offered regular prayers to God on behalf of his people and performed other religious rites. What words in your language would you use for a **priest** as a person God has chosen to offer sacrifices? What does a **priest** do in your culture? How similar is this term to the biblical idea of a **priest**?

**God Most High** The people of Canaan worshiped many false gods. The title Most High God explains that the God that Melchizedek worshiped was far superior to all of them, and was the same God that Abram worshiped. How would you express **God Most High** to mean the one and only supreme God who is superior to all?

#### 04-08

**promised** To promise means to say something that is guaranteed to happen. God gave an oath that he would never destroy the earth with a flood again. How would you translate **promised** to mean God said something that he guaranteed would happen?

**as the stars in the sky** This expression means that Abram’s descendants will be so many that no one can count them all. How would you express **as the stars in the sky** to mean Abram’s descendants would be so many that they could not be counted?

**believed** To believe means to accept or trust that it is true. What words in your language mean **believed** as in to trust or accept that something is true?

**God declared that** Abram was righteous God said that Abram was right and acceptable to God. This did not mean that Abram was sinless. Instead, it means that God said that Abram was upright because he believed in God. How would you express **God declared that** Abram was righteous to mean that God said that Abram was upright and acceptable to God?

#### 04-09

**covenant** God had already said he would give Canaan to Abram’s descendants (cf. 04:06). Now God stated the same thing again to Abram as an official promise. A **covenant** is a formal agreement between two parties which makes a promise official. What words in your language mean **covenant** as in a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill?

**from your own body** With his own body, Abram would cause his wife to become pregnant, so that, together, they would have their own, natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were very old. How would you express **from your own body** to mean Abram would have a son of his very own by his wife becoming pregnant?

The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel.
