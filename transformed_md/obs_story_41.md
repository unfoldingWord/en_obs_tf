The day after Jesus died was a Sabbath day. No one could work on the Sabbath day, so no friends of Jesus went to his tomb. But on the day after the Sabbath, very early in the morning, several women got ready to go to Jesus’ tomb. They wanted to put more spices on his body.

Before the women arrived, there was a great earthquake at the tomb. An angel came from heaven. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it.

When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus’ body had been laid. His body was not there!

##### 41-06

How would you express **After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the Jewish leaders said to Pilate** to mean the Jewish leaders spoke to Pilate after he had had Jesus crucified?

#### 41-02

**Take some soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you can** Pilate instructed them to instruct some soldiers to watch over the tomb. He told them that these soldiers should guard the tomb as effectively as they were able to in order to prevent anyone from stealing Jesus’ body. How would you express **Take some soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you can** to mean order some soldiers to watch over the tomb and do their best to prevent anyone from stealing Jesus’ body?

**they placed a seal on the stone** The religious leaders and the soldiers placed a mark on the stone that covered the entrance of the tomb. They put a soft material like clay or wax between the stone and the tomb and marked it with an official seal. If anyone moved the stone, the material would break and show that someone had entered the tomb. How would you express **they placed a seal on the stone** to mean a mark on the stone in front of the tomb to forbid people from moving the stone?

#### 41-03

**No one could work on the Sabbath day** The Sabbath day rules did not permit a Jew to walk very far or to do any other kind of work. How would you express **No one could work on the Sabbath day** to mean, according to Jewish law, Jews were not permitted to work on the Sabbath day, which included prohibiting Jews from walking a far distance?

**put more spices on his body** These spices refer to sweet-smelling herbs that were placed on a dead body to cover the bad smell. It was the custom of the Jews to wash the body and then wrap it with strong, pleasant smelling spices to prevent the dead body from smelling bad so quickly. This was also a sign of honor and devotion.

#### 41-05

**When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them** These two events happened at the same time. The women arrived at the tomb and the angel spoke to them at the same moment. How would you express **When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them** to mean the angel spoke to the womb at the time they arrived at the tomb?

**Do not be afraid** The angel instructed the women to not fear. An angel shining like lightning was a frightening sight, so that angel was trying to calm the women from being terrified. How would you express **Do not be afraid** as a command to stop being sacred?

**He has risen from the dead** The angel told the women that Jesus had resurrected from the dead. How would you express **He has risen from the dead** to mean Jesus has come back to life?

**His body was not there!** The women did not find Jesus’ body in the tomb. This was a great surprise. How would you express **His body was not there!** as a strong statement that emphasizes how surprised they were that the body of Jesus was no longer in the tomb?

#### 41-06

**Jesus has risen from the dead** The angel instructed the women to tell the disciples that Jesus had come back to life. Jesus was among those who died and were no loner alive, but God’s power caused Jesus to come to life again. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To rise from among them speaks of becoming alive again. How would you express **Jesus has risen from the dead** to mean Jesus came back to life from among all those who have died?

**he will go to Galilee ahead of you** The angel said that Jesus would arrive in Galilee before the apostles and other disciples. Jesus would meet the apostles and disciples in Galilee when they arrived.

**bowed down at his feet** The women fell down on the ground in front of Jesus. They did this symbolic action to honor Jesus as they would expect to do in the presence of a king. How would you express **bowed down at his feet** to mean the women lowered their body on the ground in front of Jesus as an act of honor and respect.

**will see me** At this point, the disciples knew that Jesus died. Jesus told the women that the disciples would see Jesus in Galilee. This would help the disciples believe that Jesus really did come back to life. How would you express **will see me** to mean the disciples would meet with Jesus in person and see that he had come back to life?
