Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over the kingdom of Israel. Ahab was an evil man. He tried to make the people worship a false god named Baal. So Elijah told King Ahab that God was going to punish the people. He said to him, “There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel until I say it will rain again.” This made Ahab so angry that he decided to kill Elijah.

##### 19-03

![](\images\image236.jpeg)

So God told Elijah to go into the wilderness to hide from Ahab. Elijah went into the wilderness to a certain stream where God directed him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring Elijah bread and meat. During this time, Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him.

##### 19-04

![](\images\image237.jpeg)

Because there was no rain, after some time the stream dried up. So Elijah went to another country close by. In that country lived a poor widow and her son. They had almost run out of food because there was no harvest. But still, as the woman took care of Elijah, God provided for her and her son. Her jar of flour and her bottle of oil never became empty. They had food during the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for about three years.

##### 19-05

![](\images\image238.jpeg)

After three and a half years, God told Elijah that he would make it rain again. He told Elijah to return to the kingdom of Israel and speak with Ahab. So Elijah went to Ahab. When Ahab saw him, he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah replied to him, “It is you who are the troublemaker! You have abandoned Yahweh. He is the true God, but you are worshiping Baal. Now you must bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to Mount Carmel.”

##### 19-06

![](\images\image239.jpeg)

So all the people of Israel went to Mount Carmel. The men who said they spoke messages for Baal also came. These were Baal’s prophets. There were 450 of them. Elijah said to the people, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yahweh is God, worship him! But if Baal is God, worship him!”

##### 19-07

![](\images\image240.jpeg)

Then Elijah said to Baal’s prophets, “Kill a bull, divide the meat into pieces, and put it on an altar for a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same later, and I will put the meat on a different altar. Then if God sends fire on the altar, you will know that he is the real God.” So the prophets of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

##### 19-08

Then the prophets of Baal prayed to Baal, “Hear us, Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer, and he did not send any fire.

##### 19-09

![](\images\image242.jpeg)

Baal’s prophets spent almost the whole day praying to Baal. They finally stopped praying. Then Elijah put the meat of another bull on an altar for God. After that, he told the people to pour 12 huge pots of water on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar were completely wet.

##### 19-10

Then Elijah prayed, “Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that you are the true God.”

##### 19-11

![](\images\image244.jpeg)

Immediately, fire fell from the sky. It burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the soil, and even the water that was around the altar. When the people saw this, they prostrated themselves to the ground and said, “Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”

##### 19-12

![](\images\image245.jpeg)

Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal and took them away from there and killed them.

##### 19-13

![](\images\image246.jpeg)

Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to your home, because the rain is coming.” Soon the sky became black, and a heavy rain began. Yahweh was ending the drought. This also showed that he is the true God.

##### 19-14

![](\images\image247.jpeg)

When Elijah finished his work, God chose a man named Elisha to be his prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to Naaman. He was the commander of an enemy army, but he had a bad skin disease. Naaman heard about Elisha, so he went to Elisha and asked him to heal him. Elisha told Naaman to go the Jordan River and dip himself in the water seven times.

##### 19-15

Naaman became angry. He refused to do this because it seemed foolish. But later he changed his mind. He went to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times into the water. When he came up from the water the last time, God healed him.

##### 19-16

![](\images\image249.jpeg)

God also sent many other prophets to the people of Israel. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols. Instead, people should act justly with each other and have mercy on each other. The prophets warned the people that they must stop doing evil and obey God instead. If the people did not do this, then God would judge them as guilty, and he would punish them.

##### 19-17

![](\images\image250.jpeg)

Most of the time, the people did not obey God. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, they put the prophet Jeremiah into a dry well and left him there to die. He sank down into the mud in the bottom of the well. But then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.

##### 19-18

The prophets continued to speak for God even though the people hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did not repent. They also reminded people that God promised to send them the Messiah.

#### 19-18

**continued to speak for God** People did not like the prophets. They hated them. Despite this, the prophets continued to tell the people what God wanted to tell them. How would you express **continued to speak for God** to mean the prophets did not stop telling the people the messages that God wanted them to speak?

**if they did not repent** The prophets warned the people. God planned to destroy them for their sin. However, God would not destroy them on the condition that the people turned from their sin and obeyed God. How would you express to mean **if they did not repent** to mean God would destroy the people if they did not turn from their sin and obey God?

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### Who were prophets and how did they serve God? (19-01, 19-02)

Purpose of Prophets: God sent prophets to his people. The prophets received messages from God and told these messages to the people. (19-01)

Message of Punishment for Sin: The prophets told the people of the punishment that would come because of their evil and idolatry. Elijah was one of God’s prophets. He went to King Ahab. Ahab was an evil king would practiced idolatry. Elijah told Ahab that God was punishing the people by sending no dew or rain for a long time. (19-02)

##### How did God provide for his prophet Elijah in the wilderness and through the widow? (19-03, 19-04)

King Ahab wanted to kill Elijah. God told Elijah to go to the wilderness. This would be a place where Elijah would hide from King Ahab.(19-03)

God directed Elijah to a stream. This stream would provide water for Elijah. (19-03)

God sent birds to bring Elijah food. Every morning and evening, the birds brought bread and meat to Elijah. This happened every day. (19-03)

King Ahab and his army looked for Elijah. They could not find him. God protected his messenger from the violence of Ahab. (19-03)

The stream dried up, but Elijah went to a country that was close. In that country, a widow took care of Elijah with a place to stay and food. (19-04).

There was a famine and the woman and her son had almost run out of food. During the whole famine God provided for the widow and her son. There was always flour in her jar of flour and always oil in her bottle of cooking oil. God caused them to never be empty. (19-04)

##### How did Elijah serve God when he confronted King Ahab and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel? (19-05, 19-06, 19-07, 19-08, 19-09, 19-10, 19-11, 19-12, 19-13)

Revelation of Truth: God told Elijah that he would make it rain again. God revealed his truth to prophets. (19-05)

Confront Sin: Elijah confronted Ahab about his sin. He told Ahab he was a troublemaker, he abandoned God, and he worshiped false God called Baal. (19-05)

Call People to Worship: Elijah rebuked the people for changing their minds about whom they would worship. He told the people that they needed to make a choice about who the real God is and worship him. (19-06)

Show Yahweh Is the True God: Elijah set up a contest between Yahweh and Baal. Two altars were prepared. The prophets of Baal prepared a sacrifice for Ball. Elijah prepared a sacrifice for Yahweh. Each was to pray that God would send fire. The one who send fire would prove to be the real God. The prophets of Baal prayed all day but Baal did not answer. As soon as Elijah prayed, God sent fire and consumed the sacrifice (and even the water poured on the altar). In this act, Elijah demonstrated that Yahweh is the one and only true God. (19-07, 19-08, 19-09, 19-10, 19-11)

Judge Idolatry: Elijah told the people to capture the prophets of Baal. The people seized the prophets of Baal and killed them. God judges and punishes false prophets who serve other gods. (19-12)

Speak with Authority: Elijah told Ahab to return to his home because the rain was coming. Elijah spoke with authority that came from God. God showed that he was the one and only true God by bringing an end to the drought. (19-13)

##### How did Elisha serve God in the healing of Naaman? (19-14, 19-15)

Miracles: Elisha became a prophet after Elijah finished his work. A commander of foreign army, Naaman, asked Elisha to heal him. Elisha told Naaman to dip himself in the Jordan River seven times. Prophets have been used by God to perform miracles. (19-14)

Changing Mind: At first, Naaman was angry that Elisha told him to dip in the Jordan River. Later, Naaman changed his mind. Prophets speak God’s messages and tell people to change their minds and follow God. (19-15)

Healing: Naaman listed to Elisha’s instructions and dipped in the Jordan River seven times. After he came out of the water the last time, Naaman was healed. Prophets show the power of God to heal. (19-15)

##### How did other prophets serve God? (19-16, 19-17, 19-18)

Many Messengers: God sent many prophets to Israel. The prophets told people to stop their idolatry. They told people to act justly and mercifully. They told them to stop evil. They called God’s people to repent. They warned people about punishment and judgment for doing evil. They called God’s people to return to obedience. God uses human messengers to deliver truth to his people. (19-16, 19-18)

Suffering: God’s people often rejected the prophets and did not listen to their message. They often mistreated the prophets and killed them. One prophet named Jeremiah was tossed into a dry well and left to die. (19-17)

Messiah: The prophets told people that God promised to send a Messiah who would save them from their sin. (19-18)
