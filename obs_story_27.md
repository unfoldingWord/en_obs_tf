## Introduction

### Key Idea

The story of the Good Samaritan teaches us that loving our neighbor as ourself is a fulfilment of God’s law.

### Creedal Verse

“For the commandments, ‘You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,’ and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” Romans 13:9-10

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 27-01

**an expert in the Jewish law** This man was someone who studied and taught the laws God had given the Israelites, as well as other Jewish laws. How would you express **an expert in the Jewish law** to mean a person who studied and has specialist/specialized knowledge in the Jewish laws?

**to inherit eternal life** The Jewish law expert asked Jesus how he could have life with God forever. The law expert was asking how he could be worthy to receive eternal life as an inheritance from God the Father. Eternal life refers to life forever with God even after the mortal body dies. How would you translate **to inherit eternal life** to mean God will give me life with him forever?

**What is written in God’s law?** Jesus asked this question because he wanted the man to think about what God’s law really teaches. Jesus asked the man what God said in his law that would answer his question. How would you express **What is written in God’s law?** as a question that asks what does God’s law teach about this?

#### 27-02

**Love the Lord your God** The man tells what the law says by quoting the law. The Jewish law commands people to love God. How would you express **Love the Lord your God** to mean we must love the Lord our God?

**with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind** The list identifies different aspects of humans. The heart refers to the part of a person that has desires and emotions. The soul refers to the nonphysical, spiritual part of a person. Strength refers to the physical body and all of its abilities. The mind refers to the part of a person that thinks, plans, and has ideas. The focus is not on each of these parts, but on the concepts that make up the whole person. The law commands people to love God with the whole self and with with every part of our person. How would you express **with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind** to mean with every part of yourself (emotions, spirit, body, and thoughts)?

**love your neighbor as yourself** Although the word neighbor normally refers to a person who lives near us, the Jews applied the term to everyone except close relatives, foreigners, and enemies. The man tells Jesus that the law teaches that people must show genuine concern for those around us the way we would show genuine concern for ourselves. People must love others around us to the same extent that we loves ourselves. How would you express **love your neighbor as yourself** as a command to have deep concern for others and show great care for others as we would have toward ourselves?

#### 27-03

**Well then** The law expert did not fully expect what Jesus said about inheriting eternal life. He likely thought Jesus would have answered differently. The man posed a question to Jesus to gain more clarity on Jesus’ answer. How would you express **Well then** to mean if what you said was in fact true?

**who is my neighbor?** The man knew that he did not love everyone, and was asking which people he needed to love. So, he asked Jesus to clarify what he meant by neighbor. He wanted to know who he was expected to consider his neighbor. How would you express **who is my neighbor?** to mean which people should I consider neighbors?

#### 27-04

**by telling a story** The way Jesus answered the law expert’s question was to tell a story. Jesus told him a short story that teaches something that is true, and delivers the lesson in a way that is easy to understand and hard to forget. Jesus used this story to teach the law expert about who he should consider his neighbor. How would you express **by telling a story** to mean the means/method Jesus used to answer the law expert’s question was to tell him a story?

**There was a Jewish man** Jesus began the story by introducing a main character in the story. The story does not specify the person’s name or the time when this story occurred. Though the events in a parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told only to teach the lesson(s) that the listener is meant to learn. How would you express **There was a Jewish man** to introduce an unnamed Jewish man as a new character to the story?

**from** Jerusalem to Jericho In this story, the Jewish man was traveling **from** Jerusalem City to Jericho City. How would you express **from** Jerusalem to Jericho to mean **from** the city of Jerusalem to the city of Jericho?

#### 27-05

**everything he had** The robbers took of the Jewish man’s possessions. How would you express **everything he had** to mean **everything he had** with him, including the clothes he was wearing?

**until he was almost dead** The robbers attacked and beat the Jewish man. They kept beating him until he was close to dying. The robbers stopped beating him before his died and left. How would you express **until he was almost dead** to mean the robbers beat the Jewish man up to the point when he nearly died?

#### 27-06

**happened to walk down** A Jewish priest was going to another city and used the same road the Jewish man had used. The priest was not just walking on the road but was traveling to get to another city. The priest was not going to see the injured man. He saw the injured man unexpectedly as he was on a journey to another place. How would you express **happened to walk down** to mean the Jewish man unexpectedly saw the injured man as he was traveling to another city?

**When he saw him, he moved to the other side of the road** The Jewish priest saw the injured man. At this time, he moved to the other side of the road. Instead of going to help the injured man, the the Jewish priest went the opposite direction to avoid walking near him. How would you express **When he saw him, he moved to the other side of the road** to mean at the time the Jewish priest saw the injured man, the priest went to the other side of the road and continued traveling?

**kept on going** The Jewish priest did not stop to help the injured man. He continued on his journey without paying attention or showing care for the injured man. How would you express **kept on going** to mean the Jewish priest continued traveling down the road without caring for the injured man?

**He completely ignored that man** The Jewish priest did not pay attention to the injured man nor did he help him. This was surprising because the priests were very religious, and would have been expected to help their fellow Jew. How would you express **He completely ignored that man** to mean the Jewish priest did not help that man and showed no concern for that man?

#### 27-07

**Not long after that** The Jewish priest saw the injured man and left. Not much time passed and then a Levite came traveling down the same road. How would you express **Not long after that** to mean very soon after the Jewish priest left a Levite traveled down the same road?

**a Levite came down the road** Levites were an Israelite tribe from the clan of Levi. Levites were religious leaders who helped the priests in the Temple. How would you express **a Levite came down the road** to mean a priestly helper from the tribe of Levi was traveling on the same road where the injured man was lying?

#### 27-08

**but he still had very strong compassion for him** The injured man was Jewish. The third person traveling down the road was a Samaritan. At this time, Samaritans and Jews did not get along. By showing compassion on the injured Jewish man, the Samaritan did the opposite to what would be expected. The Samaritan showed compassion for him rather than hatred. How would you express **but he still had very strong compassion for him** to mean the Samaritan did the opposite than would have been expected and showed great care for the injured man?

**very strong compassion** The Samaritan had a deep feeling of pity and concern for the injured man. This feeling of concern caused the Samaritan to care for and help the injured man. How would you express **very strong compassion** to mean a deep feeling of pity and concern that causes one to care for someone who is suffering or experiencing great misfortune/difficulty/pain?

#### 27-09

**his own donkey** The Samaritan showed such great compassion for the injured Jewish man that he used **his own donkey** to carry the man. How would you express **his own donkey** to mean the donkey which the Samaritan owned?

**an inn by the road** The Samaritan took the injured Jewish man to a lodging place along the road. How would you express **an inn by the road** to mean a place where travelers could get food and stay overnight?

#### 27-10

**the person in charge of** The Samaritan gave money to the manager of the inn. How would you express **the person in charge of** to mean the person who owned and managed the lodging place where the injured man was staying?

**Take care of this man** The Samaritan makes a polite request, not an order, that the manager of the inn care for the injured man. How would you express **Take care of this man** as a polite request for the inn manager to look after the injured man and provide for his needs as his heals?

**If you spend any more money than this I will repay those expenses,** The Samaritan already gave money to the inn manager to care of the injured Jewish man while the Samaritan continued on his journey. It was possible that the inn manager would have used all of this money in caring for the injured man and would have needed to use his own money to continue his care during the time the Samaritan was away. The Samaritan told the inn manager that he would pay back the inn manager any money he How would you express **If you spend any more money than this, I will repay those expenses** to mean the Samaritan would pay back the inn manager in the event he need to use his own money to continue care of the injured man while the Samaritan was away on his journey?

#### 27-11

**Which one of the three men was a neighbor** Jesus is using the word neighbor in a broad sense. Neighbor here refers to anyone that we meet who needs our help. Jesus asked the law expert which of the three characters in the story—the Jewish priest, the Levite, or the Samaritan—acted as a true neighbor in caring for the injured man. How would you express **Which one of the three men was a neighbor** as a question that asks which character in the story behaved as a true neighbor and friend by acting in a loving way to the injured man?

**You go and do the same** The behavior of the Samaritan in the story is an example of loving others, even one’s enemies. Jesus commanded the law expert to do as the Samaritan did in the story. How would you express **You go and do the same** as a command to follow the example of the Samaritan and care for others, even one’s enemies?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What did Jesus teach the Jewish law expert about what it means to have eternal life? (27-01, 27-02)

God’s Word: The Jewish law expert asked Jesus how one could inherit eternal life. Jesus asked the Jewish law expert about what God’s law taught. Jesus said that the key to eternal life is found in God’s word. (27-01)

Double Love: The Jewish law expert said that God’s law tells people to love God with our whole being (emotions, spirit, body, and thoughts) and love others as ourselves. Jesus told him that his answer was correct. We are fully devoted to God when we love God completely and love others genuinely. (27-02)

##### How did Jesus’ story explain what it means to be a bad neighbor? (27-03, 27-04, 27-05, 27-06, 27-07)

Neighbor Question: The Jewish law expert was confident that he was faithful to God. He asked Jesus to explain who was considered his neighbor. (27-03)

Injured Man: Jesus told a story about a Jewish man who was traveling on the road. He was attacked by robbers. They took all his possessions and beat him until he was close to dead. We live in a world where people are mistreated and unjustly treated. The robbers are examples of bad treatment of others. (27-04, 27-05)

Bad Examples: Two Jewish religious leaders (priest and Levite) should have cared for their fellow Israelite but they passed by him. They ignored the injured man and continued on their journey. They were bad examples of caring for others. (27-06, 27-07)

##### How did Jesus’ story explain what it means to be a good neighbor? (27-08, 27-09, 27-10, 27-11)

Very Great Compassion: The Samaritan who traveled on the same road did something surprising and unexpected. He cared for the injured man even though the injured man was a Jew. He showed genuine compassion and had mercy on the difficult situation the man was experiencing. Our ability to care for others as neighbors starts with a heart of compassion and mercy. (27-08, 27-09, 27-10, 27-11)

Compassionate Action: The Samaritan showed his very great compassion and mercy by acting sacrificially to help the injured man. The Samaritan used his own donkey, took him to an inn, paid the inn manager, and told the manager he would repay any extra expenses. The Samaritan had a very strong compassion which caused him to act in a sacrificial way to care for the needs of the man. (27-08, 27-09, 27-10)

Do Likewise: After Jesus told the story, the Jewish law expert rightly understood that the Samaritan was a genuine neighbor to the injured man. He showed mercy to someone who was ethnically different than himself. The Samaritan is an example of how we should treat others and what it means to be a neighbor. (27-11)

##### What was the spiritual condition of the Jewish law expert and how did he need to change? (27-01, 27-03, 27-11)

Plot/Trap: The Jewish law expert wanted to show everyone that Jesus was teaching wrongly. He was trying to trap Jesus in his question. He was not genuinely seeking an answer for Jesus on how to live. (27-01)

Self-Righteous: The Jewish law expert wanted to show people that his way of living was correct. He was confident in his own way of living. (27-03)

Mercy/Compassion: The Jewish law expert answered correctly many of Jesus’ questions. However, his heart and life needed to change. He needed to understand and behave in a way that was a true neighbor. He needed to follow the example of the Samaritan man by showing genuine compassion and mercy to others. (27-02, 27-11)
