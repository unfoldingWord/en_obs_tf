### Open Bible Story: The Story of the Farmer

##### 33-01

![](.\assets\images\image387.jpeg)

One day, Jesus was near the shore of the lake. He was teaching a very large crowd of people. So many people came to hear him that Jesus did not have enough room to speak to them all. So he got into a boat in the water. There he sat and taught the people.

##### 33-02

![](.\assets\images\image388.jpeg)

Jesus told this story. “A farmer went out to plant some seed. As he was spreading the seed by hand, some of the seed happened to fall on the path. But birds came and ate all of that seed.”

##### 33-03

![](.\assets\images\image389.jpeg)

“Other seed fell on rocky ground, where there was very little soil. The seed in the rocky ground sprouted quickly, but its roots were not able to go deep into the soil. When the sun came up and it got hot, the plants withered and died.”

##### 33-04

![](.\assets\images\image390.jpeg)

“Still other seed fell among thorn bushes. This seed began to grow, but the thorns choked it out. So the plants that grew from the seed in the thorny ground did not produce any grain.”

##### 33-05

![](.\assets\images\image391.jpeg)

“Other seed fell into good soil. This seed grew up and produced 30, 60, or even 100 times as much grain as the seed that had been planted. Whoever wants to follow God, let him pay attention to what I am saying!”

##### 33-06

![](.\assets\images\image392.jpeg)

This story confused the disciples. So Jesus explained, “The seed is the word of God. The path is a person who hears God’s word but does not understand it. Then the devil takes the word away from him. That is, the devil keeps him from understanding it.”

##### 33-07

![](.\assets\images\image393.jpeg)

“The rocky ground is a person who hears God’s word and accepts it with joy. But when he suffers hardships, or when other people make him suffer, he falls away from God. That is, he stops trusting in God.”

##### 33-08

![](.\assets\images\image394.jpeg)

“The thorny ground is a person who hears God’s word. But he begins to worry about many things, and he tries to make a lot of money, and he tries to get many things. After some time, he is not able to love God any longer. So what he learned from God’s word does not make him able to please God. He is like wheat stalks that do not produce any grain.”

##### 33-09

![](.\assets\images\image395.jpeg)

“But the seed in the good soil is a person who hears the word of God, believes it, and produces fruit.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 13:1-23; Mark 4:1-20; Luke 8:4-15*

> 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth. 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey. 16 The one who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five talents. 17 Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two. 18 But the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them. 20 The servant who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents. He said, ‘Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 The servant who had received two talents came and said, ‘Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more talents.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 24 Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, ‘Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter. 25 I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.’ 26 But his master answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered. 27 Therefore you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents. 29 For to everyone who possesses, more will be given—even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything, even what he does have will be taken away. 30 Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ Matthew 25:14-30

#### 33-07

How would you express **The thorny ground is a person who hears God’s word** to mean the thorny ground is like the person who hears God’s message but focuses on other things more than God?

**He is like wheat stalks that do not produce any grain** Jesus compared the person who focuses on the desires of the world more than God to stalks of wheat that do not produce grain. This person does not produce spiritual fruit or does not behave in a way that shows God’s Spirit is working in him. Jesus speaks of a person’s good works as if they were grain. How would you express **He is like wheat stalks that do not produce any grain** to mean the person who gets concerned about the desires of the world more than God and does not show spiritual fruit (evidence of God’s spirit working in him) is compared to stalks of wheat that do not produce grain?

#### 33-09

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions to grasp the truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### How did Jesus use the story of the farmer to teach God’s word/truth? (33-01, 33-02, 33-05)

Crowd: Jesus was teaching a large crowd of people near the shore of a lake. There were so many people that Jesus had to get into a boat and teach the crowd from the water. Jesus taught these people what it means to really follow God. Not everyone in the crowd followed Jesus. Jesus was using the story to teach people about what it meant to truly follow God. (33-01)

Seed Like Word of God: Just like Jesus taught the crowd, Jesus told a story of a farmer who cast seed on the ground. The farmer was planting crops. Jesus was teaching God’s word. The same seed was spread on the ground, and Jesus’ same teaching was shared with all the people listening to him. When the seed fell on different soil, there were different results. When different people heard God’s word, they received Jesus’ teaching differently, like the different soils in the story. Jesus was using the story to tell people the truth of God’s word: (33-02, 33-06)

Pay Attention: At the end of the story, Jesus told people to pay attention to what he said if they really wanted to follow God. The story taught about the spiritual reality of what it means to follow Jesus. True followers of Jesus will focus on what Jesus says, believe it, and practice it in their lives. (33-05)

Explanation: Jesus took the time to explain the parable to his disciples. At first, they did not understand what Jesus was saying after he told the story. They were confused. He explained how the seed represented the word of God. Jesus explained how different soils in the story represented how different kinds of people respond differently to God’s word (33-06).

##### What does the seed which fell on the path teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-02, 33-06)

Path: Some people respond to God’s word like a seed that falls on a path. The soil of the path is not great soil to grow crops. Birds can easily eat the seed before it has time to grow. Some people hear God’s word, and they do not accept it. (33-02)

No Truth: The path represents a person who hears God’s word but does not understand it. The devil works to try to keep people from understanding God’s word. Like the birds that ate the seed on the path before the seed could turn into plants, the devil tries to steal/take God’s word from people so they do not understand what it says. People who are ignorant of God’s word cannot truly follow Jesus. (33-06)

##### What does the seed which fell on the rocky ground teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-03, 33-07)

Rocky Ground: Some people respond to God’s word like the seed that fell on rocky ground. On rocky ground, there is very little soil. The seed can sprout quickly on this ground, but it is not able to have deep roots. As a result, the plant that sprouted fast eventually dies and withers when the heat of the sun comes out. Some people accept God’s word with joy; they stop believing it when life gets difficult. (33-03)

No Roots: The rocky ground represents a person who hears God’s word and joyfully believes it. They begin believing God’s word with joy and excitement. However, this person experiences hardships/misfortunes, and others persecute/mistreat them because they believe God’s word. This hardship is like the heat of the sun that withered the seed that grew in rocky soil. These people do not have deep roots and do not endure hardship. They give up and stop trusting in God. People need deep roots of faith to follow God. (33-07)

##### What does the seed which fell on the thorny ground teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-04, 33-08)

Thorny Ground: Some people respond to God’s word like the seed that falls on the ground full of thorn bushes. The seed grows, but the thorns crowd out the plant and keep it from growing. These plants do not grow any grain. Some people hear and accept God’s word, but other circumstances prevent their faith from growing and producing fruit. (33-04)

No Fruit: The thorny ground represents the person who hears and accepts God’s word. This person begins to grow in the faith. However, the desires of the world cause this person to be more focused on the things of the world more than God. This person worries about money and possessions and eventually does not love and please God anymore. This person grows a little but does not produce any fruit. That is, this person does show evidence in their life that God is at work. People who truly follow God will show fruit in their lives. (33-08)

##### What does the seed which fell on the good soil teach us about how some people respond to God’s word? (33-05, 33-09)

Good Soil: Some people respond to God’s word like the seed that falls on ground that is fertile. This soil causes the seed to grow and produce a lot of crops. (33-05)

Fruit: Some people hear God’s word and truly accept it. These people grow in their faith, continue to follow Jesus, love God above all, and show evidence of God’s work in their life. (33-09)

2.  When we checked this word with other believers, they said it describes God showing his kindness and favor on someone or something. These are some of the terms that we did not decide to use…

After teaching or ministering this story to the church, check the translation quality with the church community. Record any feedback from your checking experience.

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check your draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identify how each specific phrase was translated into your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
