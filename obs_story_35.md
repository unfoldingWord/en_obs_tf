##### 35-03

“There was a man who had two sons. The younger son told his father, ‘Father, I want my inheritance now!’ So the father divided his property between his two sons.”

“Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and wasted his money in sinful living.”

##### 35-05

“After that, a severe famine occurred in the land where the younger son was, and he had no money to buy food. So he took the only job he could find, feeding pigs. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”

##### 35-06

![](..\assets\images\image411.jpeg)

“Finally, the younger son said to himself, ‘What am I doing? All my father’s servants have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his servants.’”

##### 35-07

![](..\assets\images\image412.jpeg)

“The son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am not worthy to be your son.’”

##### 35-09

![](..\assets\images\image414.jpeg)

“But his father told one of his servants, ‘Go quickly and bring the best clothes and put them on my son! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the best calf so we can have a feast and celebrate, because my son was dead, but now he is alive! He was lost, but now we have found him!’”

##### 35-10

“So the people began to celebrate. Before long, the older son came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and wondered what was happening.”

##### 35-11

![](..\assets\images\image416.jpeg)

“When the older son found out that they were celebrating because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come and celebrate with them, but he refused.”

##### 35-12

![](..\assets\images\image417.jpeg)

“The older son said to his father, ‘All these years I have worked faithfully for you! I never disobeyed you, and still you did not give me even one small goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But this son of yours has wasted your money doing sinful things. When he came home, you killed the best calf to celebrate!’”

##### 35-13

“The father answered, ‘My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But it is right for us to celebrate because your brother was dead, but now is alive. He was lost, but now we have found him!’”

##### How did Jesus interact with sinners and religious leaders? (35-01, 35-02)

Sinners: Jesus was teaching a group of people who did not follow God’s laws. This group was composed of people who were considered sinful. There were tax collectors. These people were known for stealing money from people. Also, there were people who did not try to obey God. Although Jesus did not participate in their sin, Jesus was interacting with these people as friends. (35-01, 35-02)

Religious Leaders: Religious leaders criticized Jesus for being friendly with sinners. These religious leaders thought they were better than other sinners. They thought that Jesus should not be interacting with sinners in this way. The religious leaders told other people that Jesus was acting wrongly. In response, Jesus told the religious leaders a story that would confront their pride and attitude of being morally superior to others. (35-02)

##### In Jesus’ story, how did the younger son wrongly? (35-03, 35-04, 35-05)

Disrespect: The younger son asked for his inheritance before his father died. He made a demanding request that his father give him the inheritance. This would have been disrespectful and dishonoring to his father. (35-03)

Rejection of Family: The younger son took his possessions and lived in a far away land. The younger son rejected his family and wanted to live life his own way. (35-04)

Honest Acknowledgement of Sin’s Misery: The younger son came to realize that his sinful living was foolish. He chose to live in sin and it led to a life of misery. Meanwhile, even the servants in his father’s house were eating better than he was. The son came to realize that his life of sin had led to misery and life was much better in his father’s home. The younger son had to admit he foolishness of his sin and the good of his father’s house before he would return home. (35-06)

Return Home/Leave Sin: The younger son decided that he would return home to his father. His life was better with his father than living a life of sin. The younger son was restored by returning home to his father and leaving his life of sin. (35-06)

Father’s Compassion: The younger son was only received back home because the father had compassion on him. When the son was still a distance away, the father saw him and welcomed him by hugging and kissing him. (35-07)

Full Acceptance: The younger son was fully restored to a position/status of honor in the family. The father put on him the best clothes, a ring on his finger, and sandals on his feet. He also had the best calf slaughtered for a feast and celebration. The father received the son back into the family as a full son. This was because of the compassion and grace of the father. (35-09, 35-10)

Back to Life/Being Found: The father restoring the son to the family was like a dead person coming back to life and someone lost being found again. The son was given new life by being restored to his father’s family. (35-09)

##### How did the older brother respond (35-10, 35-11, 35-12, 35-13)

Anger: The older brother found out about the celebration for his younger brother and was very angry. The older brother thought the father was being unfair in his treatment of the two sons. (35-10, 35-11)

Refusing to Join Celebration: The older brother did not join the celebration. He was so angry that he refused to share the joy of his lost brother coming home and being restored to the family. The older brother did not find joy welcoming his wayward brother back home. (35-11)

Rejection: The older brother told his father that the younger brother was “this son of yours.” The older brother rejected his brother as a brother and showed disapproval of his father’s actions. The old brother rejected his younger brother as family. (35-12)

After teaching or ministering this story to the church, check the translation quality with the church community. Record any feedback from your checking experience.

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check you draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identity how each specific phrase was translated in your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
