After God led the Israelites through the Red Sea, he led them through the wilderness to a mountain called Sinai. This was the same mountain where Moses had seen the burning bush. The people set up their tents at the base of the mountain.

##### 13-02

God said to Moses and all the people of Israel, “You must always obey me and keep the covenant I am making with you. If you do this, you will be my prized possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.”

##### 13-03

For three days the people made themselves ready for God to come near to them. Then God came down to the top of Mount Sinai. When he came, there was thunder, lightning, smoke, and sounds of loud trumpets. Then Moses went by himself up the mountain.

##### 13-04

![](.\assets\images\image149.jpeg)

Then God made a covenant with the people. He said, “I am Yahweh, your God. It is I who saved you from being slaves in Egypt. Do not worship any other god.”

##### 13-05

![](.\assets\images\image150.jpeg)

“Do not make idols and do not worship them, because I, Yahweh, must be your only God. Do not use my name in a disrespectful way. Be sure to keep the Sabbath day holy. In other words, do all your work in six days, for the seventh day is a day for you to rest and to remember me.”

##### 13-06

![](.\assets\images\image151.jpeg)

“Honor your father and your mother. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not desire to have your neighbor’s wife, his house, or anything that belongs to him.”

##### 13-07

![](.\assets\images\image152.jpeg)

The people all agreed to obey the laws that God had given them. They agreed to belong to God alone and to worship only him.

##### 13-08

![](.\assets\images\image153.jpeg)

God also told the Israelites to make a large tent—the Tent of Meeting. He told them exactly how to make this tent and what things to put in it. He told them to make a large curtain to separate the tent into two rooms. God would come into the room behind the curtain and stay there. Only the high priest was allowed to go into that room where God was.

##### 13-09

![](.\assets\images\image154.jpeg)

The people must also make an altar in front of the Tent of Meeting. Anyone who had disobeyed God’s law should bring an animal to that altar. A priest would then kill it and burn it on the altar as a sacrifice to God. God said that the animal’s blood would cover that person’s sin. In this way, God would not see that sin any longer. That person would become “clean” in God’s sight. God chose Moses’ brother, Aaron, and Aaron’s descendants to be his priests.

##### 13-10

![](.\assets\images\image155.jpeg)

God wrote these Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to Moses. God also gave the people many other laws and rules to follow. God promised to bless the people and protect them if they obeyed these laws. But he said he would punish them if they did not obey them.

![](.\assets\images\image156.jpeg)

For many days, Moses remained on top of Mount Sinai. He was talking with God. But the people became tired of waiting for him to return to them. So they brought gold to Aaron and asked him to make an idol that they could worship instead of God. In this way, they sinned terribly against God.

##### 13-12

![](.\assets\images\image157.jpeg)

Aaron made a golden idol in the shape of a calf. The people began to wildly worship the idol and make sacrifices to it! God was very angry with them because of their sin. God told Moses he wanted to destroy them. But Moses asked God not to kill them. God listened to his prayer and did not destroy them.

##### 13-13

![](.\assets\images\image158.jpeg)

When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he was carrying the two stone tablets on which God had written the Ten Commandments. When Moses saw the idol, he was so angry that he smashed the tablets.

##### 13-14

![](.\assets\images\image159.jpeg)

Then Moses burned the idol and ground it into powder. He threw the powder into a stream and made the people drink the water. God sent a plague on the people and many of them died.

##### 13-15

Moses made new stone tablets for the Ten Commandments to replace the ones that he had broken. Then he climbed the mountain again and prayed that God would forgive the people.

##### What commands did God give in his covenant with the Israelites? (13-04, 13-05, 13-06)

God commanded the Israelites to obey his commands. God’s commanded the people whom he had freed to obey him. Obedience to God’s commands came after God’s gracious liberation. God’s commands were how the Israelites lived as God’s freed people (not how they gained their freedom). (13-04)

God gave the Israelites ten commandments. The first four commands told Israel how to relate to God. The next six commands told Israel how to relate to others. (13-04 ,13-05, 13-06)

The first four commands told Israel how to relate to God. God told the Israelites to worship God alone, worship God the way he told them to, treat God’s name with respect, and honor God by keeping the Sabbath day. (13-04-13-05)

The next six commands told Israel how to relate to others. God told the Israelites to honor their parents, treasure life (do not murder), practice sexual purity in marriage (do not commit adultery), be generous with and grateful for one’s possessions (do not steal), speak the truth (do not lie), and practice contentment (do not covet things others have). (13-06)

##### What were the Israelites supposed to do to keep the covenant? (13-07, 13-08, 13-09, 13-10)

Obedience: The Israelites agreed to obey God’s laws.To keep the covenant, Israel would follow God’s ways. (13-07)

Belonging: The Israelites agreed to belong to God alone. To keep the covenant, Israel would not serve any other gods. (13-07)

Worship: The Israelites committed themselves to worship God alone. To keep the covenant, Israel would be devoted to God alone. (13-07)

Tent of Meeting: God told the Israelites to build a Tent of Meeting. God would meet with his people in the inner room behind the curtain. (13-08)

Altar: God told the Israelites to make an altar in the Tent of Meeting. A priest would offer an animal sacrifice for the sin of the people. The sacrifice would cover their sin and make them clean before God. (13-09)

Stone Tablets: God recorded his commandments on tablets of stone. Like stone is solid and enduring, God was making a covenant with his people that would last. God would bless the Israelites if they kept his ways. God would punish them if they disobeyed. (13-10)

##### How well did the Israelites keep the covenant while Moses was on Mount Sinai? (13-11, 13-12, 13-13)

Impatience: The Israelites became impatient waiting for Moses while he was meeting with God on Mount Sinai. Disobedience comes from impatience and lack of trust in God. (13-11).

False Worship: The Israelites sinned terribly by having Aaron make a gold idol to worship. The gold idol was shaped like a calf. The people worshiped the idol and made sacrifices to it. The Israelites disobeyed the very first two commandments God had given. Disobeying God’s commands begins with false worship. (13-11, 13-12)

Divine Anger: God became angry at the Israelites because of their sin. God told Moses he wanted to destroy the Israelites. Disobedience to God provokes God to anger. (13-12)

Covenant Unfaithfulness: When Moses saw the Israelites worshiping the gold idol, he destroyed the stone tablets. The stone tablets represented God’s covenant with his people. Disobeying God’s commands breaks the covenant with God. (13-13)

##### What are the ways God provided for Israel to deal with their disobedience and sin? (13-09, 13-12, 13-14, 13-15)

Sacrifice: God told the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices for their sin. The sacrifice would cover the sin of a person and make them clean in God’s sight. (13-09)

Intercession: When the Israelites worshiped the gold idol, God wanted to destroy the Israelites. Moses prayed to God. God listened to Moses and God did not destroy his people. Moses also prayed that God would forgive the Israelites. (13-12, 13-15)

Repentance: Moses destroyed the gold calf. He burned it, ground it in powder, threw it in water, and had the people drink it. This action symbolized removing the idol and taking ownership for one’s sin. (13-14)

Consequences: God brought a plague on the people and many died. Even though God forgave his people, there were still consequences for their sin. (13:14)

Forgiveness: Moses asked God to forgive the Israelites. God listened to Moses’ prayer and forgave his disobedient people. (13-15)

Restoration: Moses made new stone tablets. The relationship with God and the Israelites was restored. (13-15)
