I am convinced that you are also able to exhort one another. 15 But I am writing more boldly to you about some things in order to remind you again, because of the grace given me by God. 16 This gift was that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus sent to the Gentiles, to offer as a priest the gospel of God. I should do this so that the offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable, consecrated by the Holy Spirit. 17 In Christ Jesus I have reason to boast of my service for God. 18 For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles. These are things done by word and action, 19 by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. This was so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I might fully carry out the gospel of Christ. 20 In this way, my desire has been to proclaim the gospel, but not where Christ is known by name, in order that I might not build upon another man’s foundation. 21 It is as it is written: “Those to whom no tidings of him came will see him, and those who have not heard will understand.” Romans 15:14-21
