For almost 2,000 years, more and more people around the world have been hearing the good news about Jesus the Messiah. The Church has been growing. Jesus promised he would return at the end of the world. Though he has not yet come back, he will keep his promise.

##### 50-02

![](.\assets\images\image584.jpeg)

As we wait for Jesus to return, God wants us to live in a holy way that honors him. He also wants us to tell others about his kingdom. When Jesus was living on earth, he said, “My disciples will preach the good news about the kingdom of God to people everywhere in the world, and then the end will come.”

##### 50-03

![](.\assets\images\image585.jpeg)

Many people groups still have not heard about Jesus. Before he returned to heaven, Jesus told his followers to proclaim the good news to people who have never heard it. He said, “Go and make disciples in all people groups!” and “The fields are ripe for harvest!”

##### 50-04

![](.\assets\images\image586.jpeg)

Jesus also said, “A man’s servant is not greater than his master. The important people in this world have hated me, and they will also torture you and kill you because of me. In this world you will suffer, but be strong, because I have defeated Satan, the one who rules this world. If you remain faithful to me to the end, then God will save you!”

##### 50-05

![](.\assets\images\image587.jpeg)

Jesus told his disciples a story to explain what will happen to people when the world ends. He said, “A man planted good seed in his field. While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted weed seeds among the wheat seeds, and then he went away.”

##### 50-06

![](.\assets\images\image588.jpeg)

“When the plants sprouted, the servants of the man said, ‘Master, you planted good seed in that field. So why are there weeds in it?’ The man answered, ‘Only my enemies would want to plant them. It is one of my enemies who did this.’”

##### 50-07

![](.\assets\images\image589.jpeg)

“The servants responded to their master, ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ The master said, ‘No. If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well. Wait until the harvest. Then gather the weeds into piles so you can burn them. But bring the wheat into my barn.’”

##### 50-08

![](.\assets\images\image590.jpeg)

The disciples did not understand the meaning of the story, so they asked Jesus to explain it to them. Jesus said, “The man who planted the good seed represents the Messiah. The field represents the world. The good seed represents the people of God’s kingdom.”

##### 50-09

![](.\assets\images\image591.jpeg)

“The weeds represent the people who belong to the devil, the evil one. The man’s enemy, the one who planted the weeds, represents the devil. The harvest represents the end of the world, and the harvesters represent God’s angels.”

##### 50-10

![](.\assets\images\image592.jpeg)

“When the world ends, the angels will gather together all the people who belong to the devil. The angels will throw them into a very hot fire. There those people will cry and grind their teeth in terrible suffering. But the people who are righteous, who have followed Jesus, will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God their Father.”

##### 50-11

![](.\assets\images\image593.jpeg)

Jesus also said he would return to Earth just before the world ended. He will come back the same way that he left. That is, he will have a real body and come on the clouds in the sky. When Jesus returns, every follower of Jesus who has died will rise from the dead and meet him in the sky.

##### 50-12

![](.\assets\images\image594.jpeg)

Then the followers of Jesus who are still alive will rise up into the sky and join with the other followers of Jesus who rose from the dead. They will all be with Jesus there. After that, Jesus will live with his people. They will have complete peace forever as they live together.

##### 50-13

![](.\assets\images\image595.jpeg)

Jesus promised to give a crown to everyone who believes in him. They will rule with God over everything forever. They will have perfect peace.

##### 50-14

![](.\assets\images\image596.jpeg)

But God will judge everyone who does not believe in Jesus. He will throw them into hell. There they will weep and grind their teeth and suffer forever. A fire that never goes out will continually burn them, and worms will never stop eating them.

##### 50-15

![](.\assets\images\image597.jpeg)

When Jesus returns, he will completely destroy Satan and his kingdom. He will throw Satan into hell. Satan will burn there forever, along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than obey God.

##### 50-16

![](.\assets\images\image598.jpeg)

Because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and brought sin into this world, God cursed it and decided to destroy it. But someday, God will create a new heaven and a new earth that will be perfect.

##### 50-17

![](.\assets\images\image599.jpeg)

Jesus and his people will live on the new earth, and he will reign forever over everything. He will wipe away every tear from people’s eyes. No one will suffer or be sad any longer. They will not cry. They will not be sick or die. And there will be nothing evil there. Jesus will rule his kingdom justly and with peace. He will be with his people forever.

**Though he has not yet come back, he will keep his promise** Jesus promised that he will return to earth before the end of the world. Jesus has not come back for 2,000 years.

#### 50-02

**As we wait for Jesus to return, God wants us to live in a way that is holy and that honors him** Disciples are waiting for Jesus to return to earth as he promised.

#### 50-03

**The fields are ripe for harvest** Jesus compares the work of making disciples to farmers who harvest crops in a field. The fields represent people. The words ripe for harvest mean that people are ready to accept the message of Jesus, like fields that are ready to be harvested. Jesus is telling his disciples that people are ready to be gathered and brought to God like fields whose crops are ripe and ready to be gathered. How would you express **The fields are ripe for harvest** to mean people are ready to be brought to God like fields that are ripe for harvest?

#### 50-04

**A man’s servant is not greater than his master** Jesus explains that a servant is not more important than the master who has authority over him.

How would you express **If you remain faithful to me to the end, then God will save you** to mean God will rescue people from punishment on the condition that they stay loyal to Jesus to until they die?

**weed seeds** The **weed seeds** that were planted would grow up as tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless. How would you express **weed seeds** to mean seeds that produce vegetation that cannot be used for food?

#### 50-06

#### 50-07

**Should we pull out the weeds?** The servants asked their master if he wanted them to remove the weeds from the ground. How would you express **Should we pull out the weeds?** as a question in which the servants ask if the master wanted the servants to pull out the weeds exclusively? It refers to the servants but not the master. The servants would not expect the master to take out the weeds from the field by pulling them out of the ground.

**If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well** The master explained to his servants that they would remove some of the wheat from the ground if the servants tried to remove the weeds at this time. It would be too difficult to distinguish young wheat from the weeds and to pull the weeds without accidentally uprooting the wheat. How would you express **If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well** to mean you will accidentally pull out some of the wheat also if you try to remove the weeds at this present time?

**Wait until the harvest** The master told the servants to delay pulling up the weeds until it was time to bring in the harvest of wheat. Because harvest was the right time to remove the wheat from the ground, the servants did not need to worry about accidentally removing the wheat too early by pulling out the weeds. How would you express **Wait until the harvest** to mean postpone pulling out the weeds until the crops were ripe and ready to be gathered in for the harvest?

**bring the wheat into my barn** At the time of harvest, the servants would gather the wheat into a barn. This refers to the building where the harvested wheat grain was saved and stored. How would you express **bring the wheat into my barn** to mean gather the harvested wheat into a storehouse?

**The harvest represents the end of the world** In the story, the time of the harvest teaches something about the time when the world will come to an end. How would you express **The harvest represents the end of the world** to mean the time of gathering ripe crops from the field represents the time when this present world comes to an end?

**the harvesters represent God’s angels** In the story, the people who gather the harvest refers to God’s heavenly messengers.

**But the people who are righteous, who have followed Jesus, will shine like the sun** People who follow Jesus are the same as the people who are righteous. God sees people who believe in Jesus as righteous because he forgives their sin. Also, believers act righteously because they obey Jesus’ commands. Followers of Jesus have a different/opposite experience than those who reject Jesus. The people who are righteous because they followed Jesus, will not be thrown in the fire with everyone else. Followers of Jesus will experience good things like a sun that is brightly shining.

This will happen after the followers of Jesus who died rose to meet Jesus in the air.

**After that Jesus will live with his people,** All believers will gather to be near Jesus. Then, Jesus will continue to live with his people for all time. How would you express **After that Jesus will live with his people,** to mean Jesus and his followers will live together forever subsequent to Jesus’ followers joining Jesus?

#### 50-16

**Because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and brought sin into this world** The first humans, Adam and Eve, did not do what God told them to do.

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions to grasp the truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### What mission did Jesus give to his disciples? (50-01, 50-02, 50-03, 50-04)

God’s Mission: Jesus resurrected from the dead and went back to heaven around 2,000 years ago. Since that time, more and more people have become believers. When people believe in Jesus and become his followers, the church grows in number. God is accomplishing his mission on earth to save people from their sins. Jesus will come back as he promised. Until that happens, God is causing more people to believe in Jesus. (50-01)

Worldwide Evangelism and Church Planting: Jesus commanded his followers to preach the gospel to people and tell them the message of God’s kingdom. Believers continue to share with all people groups the good news of Jesus saving people from their sin, and believers continue to plant churches throughout the world until Jesus returns to earth. In particular, Jesus commanded his followers to preach the gospel where people have never heard the message. When the gospel is shared with all peoples, the end of the world will come. (50-01, 50-02, 50-03)

Holy Living: God wants his people to live holy lives. The hope of Jesus returning to earth motivates believers to live godly lives and act in a way that honors God. The holy lives of God’s people are witnesses of the gospel to those who have not yet believed in Jesus. (50-02)

Making Disciples: Jesus specifies the mission for believers. He tells them to make disciples of all people groups. Disciples are believers who obey Jesus’ teaching. Jesus said that many people in the world are ready to become believers, like a harvest of crops ripe to be picked. (50-03)

Endure Suffering: Jesus told his followers that they would be mistreated by other people. Jesus endured suffering, and believers should expect suffering as well. Also, Jesus told his followers that they should also remain strong in suffering and not give up believing in Jesus or following Jesus. Jesus has defeated Satan, and evil no longer rules the world. Jesus has already won the battle against evil. Jesus will save those who continue to believe in Jesus and follow him until the end. (50-4)

##### What happens at the end of the world? (50-05, 50-06, 50-07, 50-08, 50-09, 50-10)

Final Judgment: Until the end of the world, people live in the world who believe in Jesus and who do not believe in Jesus. This is like a field that has weeds growing among wheat grain. God will not separate the weeds (unbelievers) from the wheat (believers) until the end of the world. At the end of the world, there will be a final judgment. The final judgment will be like a harvest in which the weeds and wheat are pulled from the ground. The weeds are gathered into a pile where they will be burned, and the wheat is gathered into a storehouse. At the end of the world, angels will gather people who do not believe in Jesus, follow the devil (i.e., the weeds), and throw them in a fire of judgment and punishment. They will suffer in sadness and pain forever. Those people who follow Jesus (i.e., the wheat) will enjoy goodness and blessing with God forever. (50-05, 50-06, 50-07, 50-08, 50-09, 50-10)

##### What events will take place? (50-11, 50-12, 50-13, 50-14, 50-15, 50-16, 50-17)

Jesus’ Return: At the end of the world, Jesus will return to the earth. He will come in the same way that he left Earth when he went back to heaven. Jesus has a real body and will come from heaven on the clouds. (50-11)

Resurrection from the Dead: People who died will come back to life. The dead who believed in Jesus will rise again and meet Jesus in the sky. Believers who are alive at the time Jesus returns will also join with Jesus in the sky. (50-11, 50-12)

Eternal Life: Jesus will live with his people forever. They will enjoy total peace. They will receive a reward from Jesus. And they will rule with Jesus forever. (50-12, 50-13)

Final Judgment: God will punish all people who do not believe in Jesus. He will throw in them into hell. In that place, there will be pain, suffering, and sadness that never ends. A fire will burn them forever and worms will not stop eating them. (50-14, 50-15)

Defeat of Satan: God will completely destroy Satan. He will throw Satan into the fire of hell, where he will experience pain and suffering forever. (50-15)

Recreation of the World: God cursed the world because of the sin of Adam and Eve. At the end of the world, God will make the world new again. God will create a new heaven and a new earth that will be perfect. There will be no more sadness, sickness, or sin. God and his people will live there for all time in peace. (50-16, 50-17)
