# Translation Decisions

*As a community, discuss some of the most noteworthy translation decisions in your draft. Summarize each decision and explain the reasons your community decided on that translation. You should update these decisions each time you check your draft with various groups of people.*

You should **measure** the quality of your translation draft. You can **record translation decisions** to make it clear why you translated things a certain way. Translation decisions can help your translation team and the surrounding community be a part of the translation process.

How can you know the quality of your translation?

1.  **Measure** the translation by marks/standards of quality (i.e., clear, accurate, natural, church-approved)
2.  **Test** the translation with others and record feedback and conversations from in the field (i.e., church and community check)
3.  **Compare** and **contrast** the translation with the source text (i.e., meaning of text and notes) and alternatives (i.e., other translation choices)
4.  **Explain** the reasons why you translated a particular portion of the text.

**Example of Translation Decision**

In OBS 01-07 we decided to translate **blessed** like this: \[actual translation\]. We decided this translation because of these reasons:

1.  The word \[actual translation\] means to cause good things to happen to someone or something. This term is used when a person desires someone or something to prosper or flourish. This term does not refer to magic or witchcraft.
2.  When we checked this word with other believers, they said it describes God showing his kindness and favor on someone or something. These are some of the terms that we did not decide to use…
3.  Many of our people will understand this word. When we discussed this phrase with the surrounding community, we discovered it was a natural way to describe God causing good and beneficial things to happen.
