### Open Bible Story: Sin Enters the World

######### 02-01

![](\images\image18.jpeg)

Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any shame because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.

######### 02-02

![](\images\image19.jpeg)

But there was a snake in the garden. He was very crafty. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?”

######### 02-03

![](\images\image20.jpeg)

The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.’”

######### 02-04

![](\images\image21.jpeg)

The snake responded to the woman, “That is not true! You will not die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does.”

######### 02-05

![](\images\image22.jpeg)

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it too.

######### 02-06

![](\images\image23.jpeg)

Suddenly, their eyes were opened and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

######### 02-07

![](\images\image24.jpeg)

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked. So I hid.”

######### 02-08

![](\images\image25.jpeg)

Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”

######### 02-09

![](\images\image26.jpeg)

God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat soil. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”

######### 02-10

![](\images\image27.jpeg)

God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”

######### 02-11

![](\images\image28.jpeg)

God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to soil.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life-giver,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

######### 02-12

![](\images\image29.jpeg)

Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the garden. God placed powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.

#### 02-01

**shame** Shame is the feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way. What word in your language mean **shame** as in disgrace or dishonor?

**crafty** To be **crafty** means to be clever and sly, with the intent to deceive. What words in your language mean **crafty** as in being skillful at deceiving others?

**Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?** The snake asks this question but already knows the answer to it. He was asking this question to create doubt in the woman’s mind and question God’s goodness. How would you phrase the question **Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?** in a way that clarifies that the serpent is trying to cause the woman to doubt what God actually said?

#### 02-03

**fruit** This is a general word for food that grows on trees. The specific **fruit** is not mentioned here. What general word in your language means **fruit** as in the food that a tree produces?

**If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.** The woman says that eating or touching the fruit will cause one to die. She does not repeat God’s command correctly. God said not to eat the fruit. He did not say not to touch it. How would you phrase you will die as in the end of one’s physical life?

#### 02-04

**like God** The man and the woman were already made in the likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be more **like God** if she understood evil. However, God never intended for her to have this knowledge. How would you phrase **like God** to mean sharing characteristics or being similar to God?

**understand good and evil** The snake is suggesting that eating the fruit will cause the humans to know from personal experience what things are good and what things are bad. How would you phrase **understand good and evil** to mean knowing things that are pleasing to God and things that are not pleasing to God?

#### 02-05

**wise** The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has. What word in your language means **wise** as in someone who understands what is the right and moral thing to do and then does that?

How would you express **they realized they were naked** to mean that at this time the man and the woman became aware that they were naked?

#### 02-07

**God walking** Although God is spirit, it seems that God regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this looked like, but it could mean that God appeared in some form as he walked through the garden. How would you say **God walking** as would be used to talk about a person walking?

**Where are you?** God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question was to force the man and the woman to explain why they were hiding and to acknowledge God was speaking to them. How would say **Where are you?** to ask someone to identify their whereabouts in order to call their attention?

**because I was naked** The word because explains that the reason Adam and Eve were afraid was that they were naked. Adam and Eve were fearful **because** they had come to know that they were naked and they were ashamed of their nakedness. How would you express **because I was naked** to mean the reason Adam and Eve were afraid was that they were naked?

**So I hid** The word so explains the result/outcome of Adam and Eve realizing they were naked. When Adam and Eve realized they were naked, they hid. How would you express **So I hid** to mean the result of Adam and Eve realizing they were naked was to hide?

#### 02-08

**The snake tricked me** The snake deceived or misled her. He lied to her. Don’t use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God. How would you say the snake tricked me to mean the snake misled the woman by lying to her?

#### 02-09

**You are cursed!** God speaks a curse on the snake. A curse means to cause bad things or great harm to come upon someone or something. A curse is the opposite of blessing. How would you phrase you are cursed to mean that God would bring hardship and harm upon the snake? (The word you choose should not imply magic.)

**will hate each other** The woman would hate the snake and the snake would hate the woman. The women’s descendants would also hate the snake’s descendants, and the snake’s descendants would hate them. How would you phrase **will hate each other** to mean that there would be hostility between the woman and the snake?

**will crush your head** The descendant of the woman will destroy the descendant of the snake. What word in your language means crush as in to flatten something with the heel of one’s foot?

**will wound his heel** The descendant of the snake will wound the descendant of the woman. What word in your language means wound as in to harm or injure?

#### 02-10

**you will die** The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. How would you phrase **you will die** to mean that life would come to an end?

**life-giver** God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth. Eve would be the female ancestor of all later generations. How would you express that Eve is the **life-giver** as in the one through whom human life would be passed on to future generations?

#### 02-12

**they must not be allowed** God is saying that he does not want humans to eat the fruit of the tree of life. How would you express **they must not be allowed** to mean that God was intending to prevent or prohibit them from eating the fruit of the tree of life?

**the tree of life** This was an actual tree with fruit. If a person ate this fruit, he would live continually and never die. How would you express **the tree of life** to mean a tree which gives people life?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### Why was life in the garden so happy? (02-01)

Adam and Eve enjoyed a happy life in the garden. Life was perfect. God had provided everything that Adam and Eve needed. God made the garden for them. There was no sin and no shame in this world. Adam and Eve enjoyed a close and peaceful relationship with God. All of this would be ruined when Adam and Eve disobeyed God. (02-01)

##### Why did the woman and the man eat the fruit? (02-02, 02-03, 02-04, 02-05)

The snake was very crafty and caused the woman to doubt what God had said. (02-02)

The snake also suggested that God commanded them not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. This was a lie. God told them they could eat from all the trees in the garden except one tree: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. (02-02)

The woman did not accurately repeat God’s command. The woman said God commanded them not to eat or touch the fruit. God did not command them not to touch it. He told them if they ate it, they would die. (02-03)

The snake denied God’s word. He said that they would not die if they disobeyed God’s command. (02-04)

The snake made it seem that God was withholding good things from the man and the woman. He told the woman that eating the fruit would make them like God. (02-04)

The humans were already created like God. (01-09)

The woman saw that the fruit looked good to eat. She chose to satisfy her desires rather than please God by following his command. (02-05)

The woman wanted to be wise. She listened to the lie of the snake. She ate the fruit to become like God and know good and evil. (02-05)

The woman gave some of the fruit to her husband and he also ate it. (02-05)

##### What happened after the woman and the man ate the fruit? (02-06, 02-07, 02-08)

The woman and the man came to realize they were naked for the first time. (02-06)

They felt shame over their nakedness and tried to cover it by sewing leaves together. They had a feeling of disgrace for doing wrong. (02-06)

They were afraid of God and they hid from him. Instead of enjoying God’s presence (cf. 02-01), they now feared him and tried to hide from him. (02-07)

When God asked them if they ate the fruit, they each blamed someone else. The man blamed the woman. The woman blamed the snake. Neither took responsibility for disobeying God. (02-08)

##### How would God’s curse effect creation? (02-09, 02-10, 02-11)

The snake would crawl on the ground. The snake spoke like he was wiser than God. As a result, God made the snake crawl on his belly. (02-09)

Humans and snakes would hate each other. Instead of ruling over the animals (cf. 01-09) and taking care of creation (cf. 01-10), snakes would attack humans and humans would kill snakes. (02-09)

Childbirth would be extremely painful. Now, obeying God’s command to fill the earth (cf. 01-15) would be painful. (02-10)

The woman would desire the man and the man would rule over her. Rather than man and woman enjoying a peaceful and cooperative relationship (cf. 01-14, 01-15), each would seek power and authority over the other. (02-10).

The ground would not be fruitful. The man was supposed to take care of the garden (cf. 01-11). Now, it would be hard for the man to work the ground and grow food. (02-11)

Man would die. Man was created from the soil (cf. 01-10) and now he would die and return to the soil/ground. (02-11)

##### What did God do for the man and the woman? (02-11, 02-12)

God clothed the humans with animal skins. Although humans disobeyed God, he provided a way to cover their shame. (02-11)
