Waiting: Jesus returned to heaven to be with God the Father. After this, the disciples remained in Jerusalem. Jesus commanded them to do this. They waiting in Jerusalem for God to send the Holy Spirit. (43-01)

Celebration of Harvest: The Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost. This was a special holy day that Jews celebrated the firstfruits of the wheat harvest. It came 50 days after Passover. On the year Jesus died, Pentecost took place about a week after Jesus went back to heaven. Pentecost celebrated God’s blessing that God provided the harvest. This represented God providing for his people. God would provide for his people by sending the Holy Spirit. (43-02, 43-03)

Power to Speak Foreign Languages: When the Holy Spirit came, he filled the believers and they spoke foreign languages that they previously did not know. A loud noise like a strong wind filled the house. Something like flames appeared over the heads of the believers. The Holy Spirit gave the disciples the power to speak foreign languages. (43-03)

Worship, Praise, and Astonishment: The people in the city of Jerusalem were astonished that Jews from Jerusalem were speaking in the native languages of people who were from other countries. The believers told about the great things God had done as they spoke in other languages. The people were amazed and astonished. (43-03, 43-04)

Abundant Provision: The people did not fully understand what was happening. They thought that the believers were drunk. Peter corrected their misunderstanding. He explained that the prophet Joel predicted that God would abundantly provide the Holy Spirit in the last days. God provided the Holy Spirit abundantly and generously. This was a sign of the final days of human history and also of God’s power to work in and through his people. (43-05)

##### What were the main parts/contents of Peter’s message to the people? (43-06, 43-07, 43-08, 43-09)

Miracles and Ministry: Peter preached that Jesus performed miracles and and did amazing things by God’s power. These miracles healed people who were sick, set people free from demons, or helped people in difficult situations. One reason Jesus did miracles was to show that he was the Messiah. (43-06)

Crucifixion: Peter preached that Jesus was crucified on a cross. Peter specially told the people that they were responsible for Jesus dying on the cross. Even though the people did not actually nail Jesus to the cross, many rejected him as the Messiah. Also, Jesus died on the cross to forgive sin. Since all people are sinners, we are part of the reason Jesus died on the cross. (43-06, 43-07, 43-09)

Resurrection: Peter preached that Jesus rose again from the dead. The Old Testament Scriptures (and prophets) predicted that the Messiah would come back to life. (43-07)

Ascension: Jesus returned to heaven and sat down on the right side of God the Father. This was a place of honor and authority. Jesus completed the work of salvation and took his rightful place as king. God promised that he would do this. God confirmed that Jesus is Lord/Ruler of all things and the promised Messiah who came to deliver people from their sin. (43-08, 43-09)

##### How did the people respond to Peter’s message? (43-10, 43-11, 43-12)

Conviction: The people felt strong emotions of guilt when they heard Peter’s message. They knew that they were guilty of sin. They felt these emotions so strongly that they asked Peter what they should do to make things right. (43-10)

Repentance: Peter told the people to repent. They all needed God to forgive their sins. The only way their guilt would be taken away was for God to forgive them. God would forgive them if they turned away from and rejected their sinful lives and turned to God. (43-10)

Baptism: Peter also told the people that they should be baptized. This means to have water applied to them in a ritual way to symbolize the forgiveness of their sins, their faith in Jesus, and their inclusion in the community of believers (the church). When the people were baptized, they became a part of the church in the city of Jerusalem. Baptism is a public profession of faith in Jesus as the Messiah, a rejection of one’s past life of sin, and a commitment to join the church community. (43-11, 43-12)

##### What did Jesus’ followers/disciples do as a community of believers? (43-01, 43-12, 43-13)

Habit of Meeting Together: Before Pentecost, the believers met together on a regular basis to pray. They practiced their faith as a community of believers. Even after the Holy Spirit came, the believers met together on a regular basis. The believers had a habit of being together. (43-01, 43-13)

Baptism: People became members of the church through baptism. Baptism is a ritual act in which believers publicly acknowledge their faith in Jesus, repent from their sin, and join the church community. (43-12)

Prayer: The believers spent time praying together. They had a habit of praying to God. (43-01, 43-13)

Fellowship: The believers ate meals together. Sharing meals together was something that people did with family and close friends. The church community was acting like a family. (43-13)

Sharing Possessions: The believers shared their possessions with one another. They helped out other community members who were in need. Again, this shows how these believers treated one another like family. (43-13)

Teaching: The believers listened to the teaching of the apostles. They also did this on a regular basis. They heard the teaching and obeyed it. (43-13)

Worship/Praise: The believers worshipped God together. They praised God for the great things he did. (43-13)

Good Reputation: The believers had a good reputation with those who were not Christians. This does not mean that Christians acted in sinful ways to make unbelievers like them. Instead, Christians lived upright and respectable lives and this caused the other people to respect them. (43-13)

New Christians: Other people became believers on a daily basis. Jesus’ disciples were witnesses of Jesus’ resurrection to others. Also, the way Christians lived together as a community was really attractive to others. Many people came to believe in Jesus, repent of their sin, get baptized, and become part of the church community. (43-07, 43-13)

3.  **Accurate**: Does any meaning in your translation of this passage appear to be **different** than the meaning of the source text? *If the meaning is different, try changing your translation so that the meaning remains the same.*
4.  **Natural**: Does anything sound **unnatural** to how you would say it in your language? *If portions of the passage sound unnatural in your language, try to make them sound the way you would say it in your language while staying true to the meaning of the source text.*
5.  **Clear**: Is anything **unclear** or **confusing** in your translation that confuses the meaning of the source text? *If portions of the passage are unclear or confusing, revise them to clearly communicate the meaning of the source text.*
6.  **Consistent**: How **consistent** is your translation within the passage and with other passages? *If portions of the passage need to be made consistent or if you need to revise translations of other passages, make these adjustments.*

#### Record Feedback

*After discussing the checking questions above as a translation community, record any feedback on your translation draft. Pay attention for parts of your translation that are translated well and parts of your translation that need correction.*

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check you draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identity how each specific phrase was translated in your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** How did you translate **so Paul and Silas baptized them**? Does it mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?
