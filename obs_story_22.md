![](.\assets\images\image280.jpeg)

In the past, God had spoken to his prophets so they could speak to his people. Then came 400 years of silence in which he did not speak to men. Then God sent an angel to a priest named Zechariah. Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth, honored God. They were very old, and she had never born any children.

##### 22-02

![](.\assets\images\image281.jpeg)

The angel said to Zechariah, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. God will fill him with the Holy Spirit, and John will get the people ready to accept the Messiah!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How can I know you are telling me the truth?”

##### 22-03

![](.\assets\images\image282.jpeg)

The angel responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife became pregnant.

##### 22-04

![](.\assets\images\image283.jpeg)

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel suddenly appeared to Elizabeth’s relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Son of the Most High God and will rule forever.”

##### 22-05

![](.\assets\images\image284.jpeg)

Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come to you. So the baby will be holy, and he will be the Son of God.” Mary believed what the angel said.

##### 22-06

![](.\assets\images\image285.jpeg)

Soon after this happened, Mary went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Mary greeted her, Elizabeth’s baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.

##### 22-07

![](.\assets\images\image286.jpeg)

After this, Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy. Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God made Zechariah able to speak again. Zechariah said, “Praise God, because he has remembered to help his people! You, my son, will be the prophet of the Most High God. You will tell the people how they can receive forgiveness for their sins!”

After he entered the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another on the way about who was the greatest. 35 Sitting down, he called the twelve together and he said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” Mark 9:31-35

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 22-01

**Then came 400 years of silence** God spoke to his people through prophets. After the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi, had prophesied three were 400 years where God did not speak to his people in this same way. How would you express **Then came 400 years of silence** to mean God did not speak to his people with prophets in the way he did in the past for a period of 400 years?

**in which he did not speak to men** In the 400 years of silence, God did not send prophets to deliver messages to his people in the same way he did in the past. How would you express **in which he did not speak to men** to mean God did not give any messages to the prophets for his people?

**honored God** Zechariah and Elizabeth had a deep respect and esteem for God. How would you express **honored God** to mean Zechariah and Elizabeth felt deep respect and esteem for God?

#### 22-02

**You will name him John.** The angel is telling Zechariah exactly what he must name John. This is a command. How would you express **You will name him John** as a command that instructs Zechariah what name he should give to his son?

**fill him with the Holy Spirit** The angel told Zechariah that the Holy Spirit would give John wisdom and power. How would you express **fill him with the Holy Spirit** to mean John would have wisdom and power through the Holy Spirit?

**John will get the people ready to accept the Messiah** God would empower John for a specific work. John’s responsibility would be to prepare people to trust and serve the Messiah. How would you express **John will get the people ready to accept the Messiah** to mean John would prepare people to acknowledge and follow the Messiah when he comes?

**My wife and I are too old to have children!** Zechariah and Elizabeth were far too old to have children by natural means. That would require God to work a miracle. Zechhariah was surprised by the angel’s message and doubted that it could be true. How would you express **My wife and I are too old to have children!** as a strong statement that emphasizes Zechariah’s surprise and doubt that an old couple like them could bear children?

**How can I know you are telling me the truth?** Zechariah doubted the angel’s message. Zechariah was asking for a sign as proof that what the angel said was true. How would you express **How can I know you are telling me the truth?** as a question that means “What can you do to prove to me that this will happen?”

#### 22-03

**Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born** Zechariah did not believe the angel’s message. This doubt was the cause of Zechariah not being able to speak until John would be born. How would you express **Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born** to mean the reason Zechariah would not be able to speak until the baby was born was Zechariah did not believe the good news of the angel’s message?

**Immediately,** Zechariah was unable to speak First the angel said Zechariah would not be able to speak, and the next thing that happened was Zechariah could not speak. How would you express **Immediately,** Zechariah was unable to speak to mean Zechariah was unable to speak as soon as the angel told him that this would be so?

#### 22-04

**pregnant** Elizabeth conceived and was with child. How would you express **pregnant** in a polite way to refer to a woman who has conceived and a child is growing in her womb?

**When Elizabeth was six months pregnant** This scene of the story happens some time later, when Elizabeth was in her sixth month of pregnancy. The main event is Mary’s pregnancy and visit to Elizabeth. How would you express **When Elizabeth was six months pregnant** to mean at the time Elizabeth had already been pregnant for six months?

**Elizabeth’s relative** Elizabeth and Mary would related in some way. We don’t know exactly how these two women were related. They were kin. How would you express **Elizabeth’s relative** as a general term to describe Mary as somehow related to Elizabeth’s family?

**was engaged** Mary was betrothed to marry Joseph. How would you express **was engaged** to mean to be promised to be Joseph’s wife in marriage?

**Son of the Most High God** This is an important title for Jesus. Mary will bear a son who will be called the Son of the Most High. Jesus is therefore a human son born of a human mother, and he is also the Son of God. How would you express **Son of the Most High God** to mean the Son of the All-Powerful God who rules over everything is and supreme over all things?

#### 22-05

**How can this be** Mary asked the angel how this could be, since she was a virgin. Mary was not doubting the truth of the angel’s words, but asking how it would happen. How would you express **How can this be** as a question in which Mary asks how can she become pregnant?

**Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come to you** By the power of God, the Holy Spirit would miraculously cause Mary to become pregnant. There was no physical or sexual contact in this event. This was a miracle. How would you express **Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come to you** to mean the Holy Spirit would powerfully come to Mary and cause her to become pregnant in a miraculous way?

**the baby will be holy** The baby promised to Mary would be set apart and belong to God. How would you express **the baby will be holy** to mean the child born to Mary would be specially set apart by God?

#### 22-06

**Soon after this happened** The angel came to Mary. A short time after that, Mary left to visit Elizabeth. How would you express **Soon after this happened** to mean Mary left to visit Elizabeth a short time after the angel visited her?

**baby jumped inside her** The baby moved suddenly inside Elizabeth’s womb in response to Mary’s greeting to Elizabeth. How would you express **baby jumped inside her** to mean the baby suddenly moved inside Elizabeth’s womb so she could feel it?

**what God had done for them** Both Mary and Elizabeth were pregnant through God’s supernatural intervention. Mary had conceived without a man, and Elizabeth had conceived with Zechariah after she was past the age of childbearing. In both cases, God has made this possible. How would you express **what God had done for them** to mean the things God miraculously accomplished for Mary and Elizabeth that would not be possible in natural means?

#### 22-07

**Praise** God Zechariah himself was praising God and he was instructing all people to praise God. How would you express **Praise** God as a strong statement of praise that instructs others to worship God as well?

**because he has remembered to help his people** The reason God is worthy of praise is how he helped his people. How would you express **because he has remembered to help his people** to mean the reason God should be praised by all people is the way he care for the needs of his people?

**the Most High God** God is greater than everything and rules over everything. How would you express **the Most High God to mean** the supreme God who is all-powerful and rules over everything?

##### How did God miraculously provide a child for Zechariah and Elizabeth? (22-01, 22-02, 22-03)

Zechariah and Elizabeth were to name the child John. He would prepare people to trust and follow the Messiah. This was good news. (22-02, 22-03)

Zechariah doubted that this could happen. Because he did not believe the angel’s message, he was unable to speak until John was born. (22-02, 22-03)

God accomplished this even though Zechariah doubted. After Zechariah was unable to speak, he returned home and his wife became pregnant. (22-03)

##### How did God miraculously provide a child for Mary?

The same angel that appeared to Zechariah appeared to a virgin named Mary. He told Mary that she would become pregnant and give birth to a son. This was a miracle because Mary was a virgin. (22-04)

How did people respond to the news of these miraculous births?
