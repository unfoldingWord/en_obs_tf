# Unit 8: Servant Ministry: Exploring Dynamics of Leadership, Authority, and Power

Each culture will understand power and authority in unique ways. The Bible has much to say about this topic. Ultimately, all authority and power comes from God. God cares about how people use their positions of leadership and power. Because we are a community of ministry, we need to have a godly approach to leadership. This series of studies helps you *approach leadership, authority, and power from a godly attitude of service*.

When he has been put to death, after three days he will rise again." 32 But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him. 33 Then they came to Capernaum. After he entered the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?" 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another on the way about who was the greatest. 35 Sitting down, he called the twelve together and he said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all." Mark 9:31-35

Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the baptism with which I will be baptized?" 39 They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "The cup that I will drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you also will be baptized. 40 But who is to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." 41 When the other ten disciples heard about this, they began to be very angry with James and John. 42 Jesus called them to himself and said, "You know those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 But it shall not be this way among you. Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of all. 45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

> 4:1 This is how a person should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the hidden truths of God. 2 Now what is required of stewards is that they are found to be trustworthy. 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. For I do not even judge myself. 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God. 6 Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." This is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other. 1 Corinthians 4:1-7

But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven. 3 And I know that this man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows— 4 was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred for anyone to say. 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. 6 If I should choose to boast, I will not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me. 7 To keep me from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become overly proud. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me. 9 But he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me. 10 Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

### Discuss the Passage (10-15 minutes)

### Pray to God (5 minutes)
Have each person identify the area of weakness and pray the following prayer to God.

We were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggling. 3 For our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit. 4 Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts. 5 For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed—God is our witness. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ. 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. 8 In this way we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us. 1 Thessalonians 2:1-8

> 4:1 This is how a person should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the hidden truths of God. 2 Now what is required of stewards is that they are found to be trustworthy. 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. For I do not even judge myself. 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God. 6 Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” This is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other. 1 Corinthians 4:1-7

No Christian can lead/minister in their own strength and power. Christian leaders go about their work by God’s strength. As a community, read the following Bible passage together to understand the godly approach to leadership, power, and authority.

> 1 I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven. 3 And I know that this man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows— 4 was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred for anyone to say. 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. 6 If I should choose to boast, I will not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me. 7 To keep me from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become overly proud. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me. 9 But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me. 10 Therefore I am content for Christ’s sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

We were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggling. 3 For our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit. 4 Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts. 5 For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed—God is our witness. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ. 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. 8 In this way we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us. 1 Thessalonians 2:1-8
