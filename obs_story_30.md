Jesus sent his apostles to preach and to teach people in many different villages. When they returned to where Jesus was, they told him what they had done.

##### 30-02

But there were many people who saw Jesus and the disciples leave in the boat. These people ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side ahead of them. So when Jesus and the disciples arrived, a large group of people was already there, waiting for them.

##### 30-03

The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, not counting the women and children. Jesus felt great compassion towards the people. To Jesus, these people were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them and healed the people among them who were sick.

Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and thanked God for the food.

Then Jesus broke the bread and the fish into pieces. He gave the pieces to his disciples to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and it never ran out! All the people ate and were satisfied.

### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 30-01

**preach** Jesus sent his disciples to announce the message of the gospel to others in various villages. This message is good news that God’s kingdom had arrived and that people should repent of their sins and come to follow Jesus as the promised Messiah. How would you express **preach** to mean proclaim or announce a message?

**teach** Jesus also sent his disciples to explain how to live in God’s kingdom. How would you express **teach** to mean to instruct people how to live in God’s ways?

**a quiet place** Jesus and his disciples were busy in ministering to others. Jesus invited his disciples to come to a remote place where there would could have a break from the noise and demands of people. How would you express **a quiet place** to mean a place with few people where they could be by themselves?

#### 30-02

**to get to the other side ahead of them** The large crowd of people ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side of the lake before Jesus and his disciples arrived by boat. How would you express **to get to the other side ahead of them** to mean to arrive on the other side of the lake before Jesus and his disciples arrived?

**when Jesus and the disciples arrived** Jesus and his disciples used a boat to travel across the lake. At the time Jesus and his disciples got to the other side of the lake, the large group of people had already came to the other side of the lake by traveling along the shore. How would you express **when Jesus and the disciples arrived** to mean the large crowd of people had already reached the other side of the lake traveling on the shoreline at the time Jesus and his disciples got to the other side of the lake by boat?

#### 30-03

**not counting the women and children** The number of men in the crowd was over 5,000. There were also many women and children in addition to the men. This number did not include women and children who were also there. This means the size of the crowd was much larger than 5,000 people. How would you express **not counting the women and children** to mean **not counting the women and children** who were also with there in addition to the men?

**Jesus felt great compassion towards the people** Jesus felt deep concern for the people. He felt pity for them because they were experiencing hard and painful situations. How would you express **Jesus felt great compassion towards the people** to mean Jesus had a deep feeling of pity and concern for the people because of the hardships and misfortunes they were suffering?

**like sheep without a shepherd** When Jesus saw the people, he compared them to sheep who had no shepherd to care for them. Without a shepherd, sheep are easily lost and in danger of enemies/predators. How you express **like sheep without a shepherd** to mean the people were vulnerable and lost, just like sheep are when they have no shepherd to take care of them?

#### 30-04

**Late in the day** At this time, the day was almost over and the evening time had almost arrived. How would you express **Late in the day** to mean when it was almost evening?

**Send the people away** The disciples politely suggested that Jesus tell the people to go somewhere else where they could find food. Since it was late in the day and there were no towns nearby, the disciples wanted to dismiss the crowd so they would have enough time to travel to a nearby town where they could get food. How would you express **Send the people away** as a polite request to tell the people to go to a town?

#### 30-05

**You give them something to eat!** Jesus instructed his disciples to find food for the people to eat. This was a strong and surprising statement since it was late in the day, no towns were nearby, and the crowd was very large. How would you express **You give them something to eat!** as a command to emphasize that the disciples themselves should find food for the people?

**How can we do that?** The disciples did not think it was possible for them to find food to feed such a large crowd, especially in the remote place where they were. The disciples are not really expecting Jesus to answer the question. They were expressing that Jesus’ request to feed the large crowd was impossible. How would you express **How can we do that?** to mean we cannot do this impossible thing you have asked us to do?

#### 30-06

**to tell the people in the crowd** Jesus told the disciples to instruct the crowd to sit in groups of 50 people. How would you express **to tell the people in the crowd** to mean instruct the group of people gathered there?

**to sit down on the grass in groups of 50 people each** Jesus commanded his disciples to speak to the people and have them sit in smaller groups of people. Each group had 50 people in it. How would you express **to sit down on the grass in groups of 50 people each** to mean to gather in smaller groups of 50 people and sit on the ground where there was grass?

#### 30-07

**Jesus took the five loaves of bread** Jesus held the five loaves of bread and the two fish in his hands. How would you express **Jesus took the five loaves of bread** to mean grasped the bread and fish his hands?

**looked up to heaven** Jesus looked up toward the sky to thank God the Father for the food. The Jews believed that heaven was located above the sky. How would you express **looked up to heaven** to mean Jesus focused his eyes upward toward the sky to speak to God?

#### 30-08

**broke the bread and the fish** Jesus separated/ripped the bread and fish into pieces in order to serve it to the people. How would you express **broke the bread and the fish** to mean tore the bread and the fish with his hands?

**it never ran out!** In this story, it is surprising and amazing that there was enough food to feed thousands of people from five loaves of bread and two fish. This was a miracle. God caused there to be enough food to feed such a large crowd. How would you express **it never ran out!** as a strong statement that there was always more food left as it was given to the people?

**were satisfied** People ate as much food as they needed until they were not hungry anymore. How would you express **were satisfied** to mean no longer hungry?

#### 30-09

**the disciples collected the food that had not been eaten** The people ate until they were no longer hungry. There was food left over after the people satisfied their hunger. How would you express **the disciples collected the food that had not been eaten** to mean Jesus’ disciples gathered together the food that was left over after people had eaten enough to satisfy their hunger?

**All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish** Jesus fed the entire crowd with five loaves of bread and two fish. Normally, this would not be enough to feed such a large crowd. This was a miracle. Jesus caused this food to multiply as he was feeding the crowd. How would you express **All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish** to mean Jesus used only five loaves of bread and two fish to feed to entire crowd and have 12 baskets of leftovers (there was not additional food from another source)?

## Theological Dialogue: Discussing the Meaning of the Story

Take time to explore the meaning of this story together as a community. Use the following discussions as a way to grasp what truth the story teaches.

### Discourse Questions

Use the following discourse questions to understand the meaning of the story. Pay attention to how the story itself addresses each question or theme.

##### How did Jesus and his disciples minister to people? (30-01, 30-02, 30-3)

Preaching and Teaching: Jesus sent his disciples to preach and teach in different villages. They preached the message of the gospel, calling people to repent of their sins and follow Jesus as the Messiah. They taught how followers of Jesus should live as citizens of God’s kingdom. (30-01)

Rest: Jesus and his disciples were busy with ministering to a lot of people. He called his disciples to retreat to a place where few people would be so they could rest. Jesus taught his disciples how to have healthy rhythms of rest and ministry. (30-01)

Compassion: Jesus had compassion on the crowd. He knew that they were vulnerable and lost, like sheep without a shepherd. They had also traveled quite far to see Jesus. Jesus genuinely and sincerely cared for people. If we want to minister to others, we must have a genuine compassion for them. (30-02, 30-03)

Teaching and Healing: Jesus healed the sick and taught people the truth. He ministered to their physical needs and taught them the truth about God. Disciples of Jesus should learn to care for both the physical needs of people and their spiritual condition before God. (30-03)

##### What does Jesus teach his disciples about what it means to faithfully follow him? (30-04, 30-05, 30-06, 30-07)

Trust: Late in the day, the disciples requested that Jesus send the people away so they could find something to eat. Jesus told his disciples to get the people something to eat. They thought this was impossible when they only had five loaves of bread and two fish. Jesus was testing his disciples to teach them to trust in him. (30-04, 30-05)

Obedience: Jesus gave his disciples instructions to have the crowd sit in groups of 50. Even though the disciples did not understand how Jesus would provide for the crowd, the disciples obeyed Jesus and organized the crowed into these smaller groups. Obeying Jesus is a sign that we really trust him. (30-06)

Gratitude: Jesus thanked God the Father for the food. Even though it was a small amount of food, Jesus taught his disciples to be thankful to God and remember that every one of our provisions comes from God. Thankfulness and gratitude is an appropriate response to God. (30-07)

##### How did Jesus provide food for the crowd? (30-08, 30-09)

Provision: Jesus divided the food into pieces. The disciples distributed these pieces of food to the people. They kept passing out the food and there continued to be enough food for the whole crowd. The food did not run out. Jesus did something that was miraculous: Jesus provided food for thousands of people with five loaves of bread and two fish. The only way to explain this miracle was that Jesus caused it to happen in his power. (30-08)

Satisfaction: The people ate until they were satisfied. With such a small amount of food one would expect everyone to only have small amount to eat. However, Jesus not only fed the whole crowd with a small amount of food, but the people ate until they were no longer hungry. Only Jesus can meet our deepest needs and longings. (30-08)

Abundance: The food that was left over filled 12 baskets. This was more food than they had at the beginning. Jesus supplied so much food from these meager portions that there was more after the people finished eating than when they Jesus started dividing up the food. Jesus provides in abundance from meager resources. (30-09)

No Limits: All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish. No extra food was supplied. Jesus caused this small quantity of food to multiply to feed a large crowd of thousands. Jesus is not limited in what he can provide. (30-09)
