### Translation Questions

Use the following translation questions to understand specific details of the passage. Discuss how you might translate these specific elements of the story.

#### 31-01

**After Jesus fed the crowd, he told the disciples to get into a boat** In the previous story, Jesus fed the crowd. Following this event, Jesus told his disciples to get into a boat. How would you express **After Jesus fed the crowd, he told the disciples to get into a boat** to mean Jesus told the disciples to get into a boat subsequent to feeding the crowd?

**while he stayed behind for a little while** Jesus told his disciple to cross the lake in a boat. During the time the disciples did this, Jesus remained back land for a short time. How would you express **while he stayed behind for a little while** to mean for a short time Jesus remained back on land at the same time the disciples sailed across the lake on a boat?

**a mountainside** Jesus went up on the side of a mountain to pray. How would you express **a mountainside** to mean the side of a mountain?

#### 31-02

**During this time** The disciples were rowing the boat across the lake at the same time Jesus was praying on the side of the mountain. How would you express **During this time** to mean while Jesus was praying on the mountainside?

**the wind was blowing hard against them** The disciples were traveling by boat across the lake. The boat had a sail, but it would not have worked when the wind was against them. So, they needed to row the boat. The wind was moving in the opposing direction they were rowing. How would you express **the wind was blowing hard against them** to mean wind was moving in the opposite direction the disciples were rowing?

**they had only reached the middle of the lake** If the wind was calm and the conditions on the water were fare, one would expect the disciples to have made more progress across the lake. The wind blowing against the disciples slowed down their progress across the lake. How would you express **they had only reached the middle of the lake** to mean the disciples were traveling across the lake with difficulty because of the wind and only made it about halfway across the lake?

#### 31-03

**At that time** The disciples were in the boat rowing against the wind. When they reached the middle of the lake, it was late in the night. Jesus also finished praying late at night. How would you express **At that time** to mean Jesus finished praying at the time late in the night when the disciples reached the middle of the lake?

**He walked on top of the water toward their boat** The boat was in the middle of the lake. Jesus walked across the lake in the direction of the boat. This is a miracle. He walked on the water without sinking. How would you express **He walked on top of the water toward their boat** to mean Jesus walked on the surface of the water across the lake in the direction of the disciples’ boat?

#### 31-04

**a ghost** The disciples did not expect to see Jesus. They also did not think that a person could walk on water. So, they thought Jesus was a spirit, since normally a human being cannot walk on water. How would you express **a ghost** to mean a spirit being without a physical body?

**Do not be afraid** Jesus told his disciples to not fear. How would you express **Do not be afraid** as a command to stop being afraid?

**It is I!** The disciples thought that Jesus was a spirit. Jesus told his disciples to stop being afraid and told them who he was. How would you express **It is I!** to mean “It is me, Jesus”?

#### 31-05

**if it is you** At this time, Peter did not fully believe that it was Jesus. To Peter, it seemed more likely that it was a spirit and not Jesus since people/humans do not normally walk on top of water. Peter request that Jesus prove to him that he was really Jesus by telling Peter to come out of the boat and walk on the surface of the water. How would you express **if it is you** to mean if it is really you, and not a ghost?

**Come!** Jesus commanded Peter to come to out on the water and walk toward Jesus on the surface of the water like Jesus was doing. How would you express **Come!** as a command to come here and walk to me?

#### 31-06

**after walking a short distance** Peter did not walk on top of the water for a long time. When he started walking on the water toward Jesus he was looking at Jesus. Peter only walked a short distance and then he stopped looking at Jesus and started looking at the waves. How would you express **after walking a short distance** to mean Peter only walked a small distance on the water when he stopped looking at Jesus?

**turned his eyes away from** After Peter walked a short distance, he looked away from Jesus and starting looking at the waves. How would you express **turned his eyes away from** to mean stopped looking at Jesus?

#### 31-07

**Right away, Jesus reached out and grabbed him** Peter started to sink in the water and he called out for Jesus to rescue him. Jesus did not delay and grabbed Peter to keep him from sinking. How would you express **Right away, Jesus reached out and grabbed him** to mean Jesus immediately grasped Peter (without delay) to keep him from sinking?

**You have so little faith!** Jesus told Peter that he did not deeply trust Jesus. This strong statement is a rebuke of Peter’s faith. How would you express **You have so little faith!** as a strong statement that rebuked Peter for having very little trust in Jesus?

**Why did you not trust me to keep you safe?** Jesus uses a question to tell Peter that he should not have doubted. Peter should have known that Jesus was able to protect him. Jesus is saying that Peter should not have doubted Jesus. How would you express **Why did you not trust me to keep you safe?** as a question that means Peter should not have doubted that Jesus could keep him from sinking?

#### 31-08

**The disciples were amazed** The disciples were very surprised at what they saw. Jesus walked on the water, Peter walked on the water, and Jesus rescued Peter from drowning. These were very astonishing events. How would you express **The disciples were amazed** to mean the disciples were completely amazed at what Jesus had done?

**Truly, you are the Son of God** The disciples knew with confidence that Jesus was really God’s Son. How would you express **Truly, you are the Son of God** to mean it really is true that you are the Son of God?
