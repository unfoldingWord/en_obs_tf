**led him away** The soldiers took Jesus away as one would take a prisoner away to a sentence. How would you express **led him away** to mean forced him to go with them as a prisoner?

#### 40-02

**a place called ‘the Skull’** The place where the soldiers crucified Jesus was called the Skull. This is a small escarpment near Jerusalem with a rocky, white face which looks somewhat like a skull. How would you express **a place called ‘the Skull’** to mean a place that people called ‘the Skull’?

**forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** Jesus prayed to God the Father that he would not punish them for their sin because they did not really understand who they were crucifying. The soldiers thought Jesus was only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that he was the Son of God. How would you express **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** to mean they do not understand the meaning of what they are doing, so please forgive them?

#### 40-03

**the soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing** The soldiers played a game of betting to win Jesus’ clothes.

**We are guilty of doing many bad things, but this man is innocent** The robber admitted that the two robbers had committed crimes but Jesus was not guilty of any crime. The robbers deserved to die for their crimes but Jesus did not do anything wrong to deserve to die. How would you express **We are guilty of doing many bad things, but this man is innocent** to mean the two robbers did evil things and deserved to die, but this man, Jesus, had done nothing wrong and did not deserve to die?

**Please remember me** The robber asked Jesus to allow him to be with Jesus. Remember here does not mean to recall something after forgetting it. The robber is making a humble request that Jesus would give him access to God’s kingdom.

#### 40-05

**If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself!** Jesus is really the Son of God. He also has all power. Jesus allowed people to crucify him on the cross. The people mocking Jesus did not believe this. They were trying to mock Jesus because they expected the Son of God to not be mistreated and crucified like what was happening to Jesus. They did not believe Jesus was the Son of God. They also did not understand why Jesus was dying on the cross. The people were mocking Jesus, but he truly was the Son of God. How would you express **If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself!** as a way to mock Jesus by saying that if he really was the Son of God he should come off the cross and rescue himself from death?

**Then we will believe you** The people said that they would believe that Jesus is the Messiah if Jesus came off of the cross by his own power. They did not really believe in him. They only said they would believe in Jesus if Jesus performed this act. Jesus was dying on the cross for a reason the people did not believe or understand. How would you express **Then we will believe you** to mean the people would believe Jesus is the Messiah if he showed them his power and came down from the cross?

#### 40-06

**even though it was the middle of the day** The sky in that region became dark like it was night time. However, it was the middle of the day. This is a surprising thing to happen in the middle of the day. It was a miracle.

#### 40-07

**It is finished!** Jesus said these words right before he died on the cross. He was saying that he accomplished the work that God gave Jesus to do. This means that Jesus’ work of salvation was complete. How would you express **It is finished!** to mean the work of salvation is completed or Jesus accomplished the work of salvation by dying on the cross?

**I am giving my spirit into your hands** Jesus gave himself to God’s protection and safekeeping. Jesus trusted God the Father to care for him after death. How would you express **I am giving my spirit into your hands** to mean Jesus entrusted his spirit to God’s care?

**bowed his head and gave up his spirit** This is the point when Jesus died. Because his physical body final died, Jesus’ head moved downward and his spirit went to God. These phrases tell that Jesus died. How would you express **bowed his head and gave up his spirit** to mean when Jesus died he lowered his head and released his spirit to God?

**In the Temple, the large curtain that separated the people from the presence of God was torn in two** At the time Jesus died, God caused the large curtain in the Temple to be divided into two pieces. This curtain was a large, strong fabric hung in the Temple. It was a thick curtain or hanging fabric that separated one room from another. This curtain separated the people from the most holy place in the temple. When the curtain was torn, the people now had access to God’s presence.

Jesus was punished for the sin of people instead of humans being punished for their sin. The tearing of the curtain showed that the barrier between God and people had been removed. Only those who believe in Jesus can have forgiveness of their sin. How would you express **Jesus opened the way for people to come to God** to mean Jesus made it possible for people to come near God and know him personally because of his death on the cross?

#### 40-09

#### Create Checking Questions

You can use **Translation Questions** to check you draft. Each **Translation Question** explains the meaning of a specific part of the story and asks you to consider how you would translate that part of the story in your own language. Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identity how each specific phrase was translated in your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus. How would you express **to proclaim the good news about Jesus** to mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?
