One of Jesus’ disciples was a man named Judas. Judas was in charge of the apostles’ moneybag, but he often stole money out of the bag.

Peter replied, “Even if all the others abandon you, I will not!” Then Jesus said to Peter, “Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.”

Jesus prayed three times, “My Father, if it is possible, please let me not have to drink this cup of suffering.

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. When he returned the third time, Jesus said, “Wake up! My betrayer is here.”

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas came to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Teacher,” and kissed him. He did this to show the Jewish leaders the man to arrest. Then Jesus said, “Judas, are you betraying me with a kiss?”

As the soldiers were seizing Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest. But Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me, but I must obey my Father.” Jesus healed the man’s ear. Then all the disciples ran away.

##### What was important about the Passover meal Jesus had with his disciples? (38-01, 38-02, 38-03, 38-04, 38-05)

Passover Meal: The Passover meal was a celebration meal Jews did every year to commemorate God liberating Israel from slavery in Egypt. At the end of Jesus’ three-year ministry, Jesus wanted to celebrate this feast with his disciples before he was killed. Jesus’ death on the cross would liberate people from the bondage of sin just like God liberated Israel from Egypt in the first Passover God. (38-01)

Jewish Plan to Kill Jesus: The Jewish leaders did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. The Jews wanted to kill Jesus. The meal anticipated Jesus’ crucifixion. (38-02)

Judas’ Plot: Judas agreed to betray Jesus to the Jewish leaders for 30 pieces of silver. This happened just like the prophets predicted. God planned for Jesus to be arrested and die on the cross. The prophets told about this beforehand. (38-02, 38-03)

Bread Represents Jesus’ Body: Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples in Jerusalem. During the meal, he took bread, broke it in pieces, and gave it to his disciples. This bread represented Jesus body. Jesus would die for them and sacrifice his body for them. The meal/bread helped Jesus’ disciples remember the sacrifice Jesus made by dying for them. (38-04)

Drink Represents Jesus’ Blood: During the meal, Jesus offered his disciples to drink from a cup of wine. The wine represented Jesus’ blood. Jesus would die as a sacrifice and his blood would provide the forgiveness of sins. This forgiveness would make the New Covenant with God possible. Jesus had them drink wine from this cup to help them remember what Jesus was accomplishing by dying as their sacrifice. (38-05)

##### How did Jesus’ betrayal and arrest come about? (38-02, 38-03, 38-06, 38-07, 38-08, 38-09, 38-10, 38-14, 38-15)

Greed and Deceit: Judas was in charge of the moneybag where the money for the disciples was stored. He had a habit of stealing money from the money bag. Judas had developed a habit of deceit and he was greedy. (38-02)

Prophets Prophesied and Judas Conspired: Judas made a deal with the Jewish leaders to help them arrest Jesus in exchange for money. Judas knew the Jewish leaders wanted to kill Jesus. Judas agreed to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. This was prophesied by the Old Testament prophets and Judas himself sought out the opportunity to betray Jesus for money. The prophets predicted Jesus’ betrayal. (38-02, 38-03)

Betrayer Identified: During the meal, Jesus told his disciples that one of them would betray him. The disciples were shocked at this announcement. Jesus identified Judas as the betrayer by handing him a piece of bread. (38-06)

Satan Controls Judas: Judas took the piece of bread and Satan entered him. Satan controlled Judas and caused him to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. (38-07)

Disciples Abandon Jesus: Jesus also predicted that all his disciples would abandon him. This was also predicted by the Old Testament prophets. Jesus’ disciples would desert Jesus on the night of his betrayal. Peter told Jesus that he would not abandon Jesus even if all the other disciples deserted him. Jesus told Peter that he would deny Jesus three times before the next morning. One of Jesus’ main disciples would abandon Jesus three times. Peter and all the disciples said they would not deny Jesus even if they had to die. (38-08, 38-09, 38-10)

Large Crowd and Weapons: Judas came to Gethsemane with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd. The crowd was carrying swords and clubs. They planned to use force if necessary to arrest Jesus. (38-14)

Sign of Friendship: Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss. This kiss was as sign of friendship and respect. It was very evil to pretend to be Jesus’ friend but act with deceit and bad motives in a way that would harm him. (38-14)

Voluntary Arrest: Jesus did not have Peter defend him with a sword. He told him to put away the sword. Jesus voluntarily give himself up to be arrested because he knew that it was the will of God the Father. (38-15)

##### Why was Jesus’ time of prayer in Gethsemane important? (38-11, 38-12, 38-13)

Prayer: Jesus took his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He told them to pray so they would not enter temptation. Prayer is a way to stay faithful to Jesus and resist the temptations of Satan. (38-11)

Doing God’s Will: Jesus prayed that God would allow him not to suffer if it was possible. Jesus knew, however, that only by suffering and dying could God forgive sin. So, Jesus asked that God’s will and plan would happen even if mean that Jesus would suffer and die. Jesus showed that prayer is a way to deepen our commitment to God. (38-12)

Expressing Sorrow and Finding Strength in God: During this time of prayer, Jesus was very troubled and sweat drops like blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him. Prayer is a way to express our sorrow and find strength from God. (38-12)

Staying Watchful: Jesus prayed his prayer three times. Each time he returned to his disciples, they were sleeping. Jesus was practicing diligence and perseverance in prayer. The disciples showed weakness by falling asleep at a time when they needed to be watchful and alert. Prayer is a means to stay watchful and alert against evil and temptation. (38-13)

Change each **Translation Question** into a **Checking Question** by asking the following questions. The first question asks you to identity how each specific phrase was translated in your language. The second question asks people in the church to determine if your translation of the phrase expresses the meaning clearly, accurately, and naturally. Look at the following examples to see how to change **Translation Questions** into **Checking Questions**:

#### Translation Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** Paul and Silas traveled to Philippi for the purpose of preaching the gospel. The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves people from their sins if they will believe in Jesus.

#### Translation Question Example 2

**a merchant** Paul and Silas met a woman named Lydia at the place by the river. She owned a business and sold items to make money. How would you express **a merchant** to mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Translation Question Example 3

**so Paul and Silas baptized them** The jailer and his whole family followed Paul’s instructions. They believed in Jesus. The result of this was Paul and Silas baptized them. How would you express **so Paul and Silas baptized them** to mean the result of the jailer and his family believing in Jesus that Paul and Silas baptized all of them?

You can change these into **Checking Questions** like this:

#### Checking Question Example 1

**to proclaim the good news about Jesus** How did you translate **to proclaim the good news about Jesus**? Does it mean to tell other people the message about how Jesus can save people from their sins?

#### Checking Question Example 2

**a merchant** How did you translate **a merchant**? Does it mean a business owner who sells items for a profit?

#### Checking Question Example 3
